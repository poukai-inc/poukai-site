# pouk.ai — backlog

Things to ship before / around launch. Roughly priority-ordered within sections.

## Blockers for launch

- [x] **Register `pouk.ai`.** Done 2026-05-13 via Vercel (registrar partner: Name.com, Inc.). Registration term covers through 2028-05-13. Originally noted as "Porkbun" in this backlog — that was a mis-recording; the actual purchase went through Vercel, which is why NS records pointed to `ns1.vercel-dns.com`/`ns2.vercel-dns.com` from the start.
- [x] **Generate `og.png`** (1200×630). Done 2026-05-13. Lives in the DS repo at `poukai-ui/src/brand/og.png`. **Operational follow-up**: per masterplan section 2A, `og.png` belongs in the site repo (it's marketing artwork, not a brand primitive). Either copy into the site repo root before cutover, or have `pouk-ai-engineer` pull it into `public/og.png` during the Astro scaffold round.
- [x] **Generate `apple-touch-icon.png`** (180×180). Done 2026-05-13. Same location/follow-up as `og.png` — currently at `poukai-ui/src/brand/apple-touch-icon.png`; needs to land at `public/apple-touch-icon.png` in the site repo before cutover.
- [x] **Update favicon** to the feather isotype. Done 2026-05-13. Favicon variations (`favicon-16x16.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`, `android-chrome-192x192.png`, `android-chrome-512x512.png`) generated in `poukai-ui/src/brand/`. **Operational follow-up**: index.html still references the old placeholder altimeter inline-SVG favicon at line 33; the new files need to be wired in (either inline-SVG-from-the-isotype path or `<link rel="icon" href="/favicon-32x32.png">` references) during the Astro scaffold round or as a one-off patch to `index.html` if cutover comes first.
- [x] Add `robots.txt`. Done 2026-05-13 (commit `bc81bc3`).
- [x] Add `sitemap.xml`. Done 2026-05-13 (commit `bc81bc3`).
- [x] Add `vercel.json` at the repo root. Done 2026-05-13 (commit `bc81bc3`).
- [x] Resolve JSON-LD ↔ CSP. Closed — `vercel.json` ships without CSP per D-17, so the conflict never materialized. Re-open if/when a CSP is introduced.

## DNS + email — **manual (Arian executes)**

These touch external systems (Vercel DNS dashboard, email host onboarding) that the engineering agents can't reach. Arian's lane.

**Authority correction (2026-05-16):** When the domain was first set up, NS records were pointed at Vercel (`ns1.vercel-dns.com`, `ns2.vercel-dns.com`), not kept at Porkbun. So all DNS edits happen inside the **Vercel dashboard → pouk.ai → DNS**, not Porkbun. The original Porkbun-centric instructions below have been rewritten.

- [x] **Vercel DNS — apex + www** — verified live 2026-05-16. `dig +short pouk.ai` returns Vercel anycast IPs (`216.198.79.1`, `64.29.17.1`); `dig +short www.pouk.ai` likewise. Vercel manages these automatically once the domain is added to a project — no manual ALIAS/CNAME entries were needed because Vercel is also the nameserver. Closed.
- [x] **Vercel domain binding** — verified live 2026-05-16. `curl -sI https://pouk.ai/` returns `HTTP/2 200`, `server: Vercel`, `strict-transport-security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`, and the full security-header stack from `vercel.json`. `www.pouk.ai` returns `307 → https://pouk.ai/`. TLS is provisioned and HSTS is preload-eligible. Closed.
- [x] **CAA records** — verified live 2026-05-16. `dig +short CAA pouk.ai` returns three issuers (`letsencrypt.org`, `pki.goog`, `sectigo.com`) — broader than the original backlog ask, which only requested the first two. The wider set is fine; Vercel uses Let's Encrypt by default but the extra issuers don't loosen security (CAA whitelists, not blacklists). Closed.
- [x] **Pick email host for `hello@pouk.ai`** — **Google Workspace Business Starter ($7/mo)**. Chosen 2026-05-16. Rationale: hyperscaler reputation (gold-tier deliverability for prospect outreach), drag-along Docs/Drive/Calendar/Meet for consultancy work, 99.9% reliability. Closed.

- [x] **Email DNS records** at Vercel — verified live 2026-05-16. All five records in place:
  - `MX pouk.ai` → `smtp.google.com` priority 1 ✅
  - `TXT @ (root)` → `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com -all` ✅
  - `TXT _dmarc.pouk.ai` → `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:hello@pouk.ai; pct=100` ✅ (will ratchet to `p=quarantine` after ~30 days once aligned sends are routine)
  - `TXT google._domainkey.pouk.ai` → DKIM public key (2048-bit) ✅
  - `TXT @ google-site-verification=...` → temporary verification record (can delete or leave; harmless) ✅

- [x] **Verify email DNS with `dig`** — verified live 2026-05-16. All records return correct values:
  ```
  $ dig +short MX pouk.ai
  1 smtp.google.com.
  
  $ dig +short TXT pouk.ai | grep spf
  "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com -all"
  
  $ dig +short TXT _dmarc.pouk.ai
  "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:hello@pouk.ai; pct=100"
  
  $ dig +short TXT google._domainkey.pouk.ai
  "v=DKIM1;k=rsa;p=MIIBIj..." (full public key)
  ```
  DNS propagation complete. SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment ready for prospect outreach. Closed.

**Email is production-ready.** The `hello@pouk.ai` mailbox can send and receive. The first prospect email will not land in spam.

## Asset migration to site repo

Closed by `pouk-ai-engineer` during the Astro round-1 build (commit `13f8668`). Brand assets pulled from `poukai-ui/src/brand/` into the site's `public/` directory:

- [x] `public/og.png` (1200×630). Done 2026-05-13.
- [x] `public/apple-touch-icon.png` (180×180). Done 2026-05-13.
- [x] `public/favicon-{16x16,32x32}.png`, `public/android-chrome-{192x192,512x512}.png`. Done 2026-05-13.
- [x] **`index.html` favicon `<link>`** — **Closed 2026-05-17 as stale.** The holding `public/index.html` was deleted in commit `9e56cdb` ("feat: port / to Astro, retire static index.html") when `/` ported into Astro. There is no `index.html` to update — every route now flows through `BaseLayout.astro`, which already references `/favicon-32x32.png`, `/favicon-16x16.png`, and `/apple-touch-icon.png`. The original founder rule that gated this work no longer applies. Verified: `ls public/index.html` returns no such file.

## DS-side coordination (`@poukai-inc/poukai-ui` maintainers' lane)

Tracked here so the site engineer doesn't lose sight while the DS team works in parallel. None of these are this repo's lane to fix.

- [x] **`@poukai-inc/ui@0.2.1` published** with the `cpy --flat` fix for `dist/tokens.css`. Done 2026-05-14 via DS PR #5 + version-bump PR #6.
- [x] **Component CSS not delivered to consumers (`SiteShell`, `RoleCard`, `Hero`, `Principle`, `FailureMode` render unstyled).** Closed 2026-05-16 — verified fixed in `@poukai-inc/ui@0.6.1`. Resolution went beyond the suggested one-line fix: the DS now ships per-component CSS files (`SiteShell.css`, `FailureMode.css`, `Stat.css`, `Wordmark.css`) and every component chunk self-imports its stylesheet (`import './SiteShell.css';` in `dist/SiteShell-*.js`, matching `require()` in `.cjs`). Combined with `"sideEffects": ["**/*.css"]` in package.json, bundlers preserve the imports — `import { SiteShell } from "@poukai-inc/ui"` now pulls the needed CSS automatically. Per-component code-splitting is actually superior to a single `style.css` import; consumers only receive CSS for components they use. *Original bug context (2026-05-14):* the DS built a combined `dist/style.css` containing all per-component scoped CSS-module styles, but (a) the package.json `exports` field exposed only `./tokens.css`, not `./style.css`, and (b) the ESM/CJS entry files didn't `import "./style.css"`. Result: when a consumer did `import { SiteShell } from "@poukai-inc/ui"`, only JS landed — every `.poukai_<hash>` class on the rendered DOM was a dangling reference, and components fell back to user-agent defaults (nav rendered as a bulleted list, header bar missing, card hairlines vanished, etc.). Bug surface was the entire DS, not just `SiteShell` — `SiteShell` only looked worst because it's the most layout-heavy.

## Security hygiene (once email lands)

- [x] **Add `/.well-known/security.txt`** — RFC 9116 disclosure file. Done 2026-05-17. File created at `public/.well-known/security.txt` (will be served from `dist/` after next build/deploy). Contents:
  ```
  Contact: security@pouk.ai
  Expires: 2027-05-16T00:00:00Z
  Preferred-Languages: en
  ```
  Disclosure file tells security researchers how to report vulnerabilities. Contact routes to the freshly-live `hello@pouk.ai` mailbox. Expires field set to rotate annually (2026-05-16 + 1 year). This item was SOFT until email went live (2026-05-16); now HARD per Decision D-21 and Technical Requirement R-081. Closed.

- [x] **Bump `astro` past 5.15.8 — resolves [GHSA-wrwg-2hg8-v723](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wrwg-2hg8-v723) (reflected XSS via server islands)** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Bumped `astro@5.7.13` → `astro@5.18.1` (latest stable in the 5.x line, 11 minor versions of fixes and features absorbed). `pnpm install` resolved cleanly with no peer-dep conflicts: `@poukai-inc/ui@0.6.1` only peer-deps `lucide-react` (not astro), `@astrojs/react@4.2.1` and `@astrojs/sitemap@3.3.0` accepted the new astro without complaint, and `astro-compress@2.3.3` continued to work. `pnpm build` exits 0; all four routes built; `dist/index.html` is **byte-identical at 13,429 bytes** to the pre-bump build — no rendered-output regressions. Content spot-check confirmed: status-line copy ("Currently taking conversations"), Pouākai origin sentence, `/why-ai` lede link, `hello@pouk.ai` CTA all present. Sitemap unchanged. `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=high` now exits 0 (2 findings: 1 low + 1 moderate, both allowed by R-049). **CI audit gate now green.**

- [x] **Bump `svgo` past 3.3.3 (via `astro-compress`) — resolves [GHSA-xpqw-6gx7-v673](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xpqw-6gx7-v673) (Billion Laughs DoS)** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Added `pnpm.overrides.svgo: ^3.3.3` to [package.json](package.json); `pnpm install` resolved astro-compress's transitive svgo from `3.3.2` → `3.3.3` (verified in `pnpm-lock.yaml` — the entry for svgo@3.3.2 is gone, only 3.3.3 remains). Rebuild green; the SVG-compression pass (R-054 / R-018 image stats unchanged) still runs cleanly. `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=high` now reports 1 high finding (astro) instead of 2 — svgo line cleared. Audit gate one step closer to green; astro bump remains.

## Brand assets in `/brand/` — status

`/brand/` originally contained: `avatar.png`, `avatar-isotype.png`, `banner.png`, `isotype svg.png`, `logo svg.png`, `avatar svg.svg`. **Archived to Google Drive on 2026-05-17** — source files no longer live in either repo. Site repo ships only the derived/finalized artwork in `public/`.

- [x] **Header logo** — done. Inlined a cleaned version of `avatar svg.svg` (full POUKAI logo) into the page header on 2026-05-08.
- [x] `banner.png` — closed 2026-05-17. Moot: a fresh `og.png` (1200×630) was generated to spec and shipped at [`public/og.png`](public/og.png), wired into [`BaseLayout.astro:43`](src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro:43). `banner.png` was never used as the OG card. Source archived to Drive.
- [x] `avatar.png` / `avatar-isotype.png` — closed 2026-05-17. Moot: `apple-touch-icon.png` (180×180) shipped at [`public/apple-touch-icon.png`](public/apple-touch-icon.png) and wired into [`BaseLayout.astro:125`](src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro:125). Visual consistency with the feather-isotype favicon set is already in production. Source archived to Drive.

## Nice-to-haves (post-launch)

- [x] **Lighthouse audit on production URL** — closed 2026-05-17. Audited all four routes on `https://pouk.ai/*` (mobile, simulated throttling, `npx lighthouse@11.5.1`, 3-run median to match `.lighthouserc.json`).

  **Pre-fix baseline (production, 2026-05-17 morning):**
  | Route | Perf | A11y | BP | SEO |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `/` | 98 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
  | `/why-ai/` | 99 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
  | `/roles/` | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
  | `/principles/` | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |

  A11y / Best-practices / SEO already at 100 across the board. Perf gaps traced to **duplicate font loads** — preload `<link>`s in [`BaseLayout.astro`](src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro) pointed at `/fonts/*.woff2` (manual copies in `public/fonts/`), while `@poukai-inc/ui`'s bundled `tokens.css` referenced the Vite-hashed `/_astro/*.woff2` copies. Two physical files for each face → preload wasted, and the CSS-side font still triggered a swap shift after first paint (CLS 0.077 on `/why-ai/` came entirely from Geist + Instrument Serif font-swap; LCP/FCP penalties on `/` from the same swap chain).

  **Fix:** import fonts via Astro `?url` from the DS package so preload `href` and CSS `url()` resolve to the *same* hashed `/_astro/<hash>.woff2`. Single fetch per face, font available before first paint, no swap. Deleted `public/fonts/` (3 × woff2, ~125 KB) — pure dead weight after the fix.

  **Local post-fix verification** (`pnpm preview` + `npx lighthouse`, single-run, simulated mobile):
  | Route | Perf | A11y | BP | SEO |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `/` | **100** | 100 | 100 | 100 |
  | `/principles/` | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
  | `/roles/` | 99 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
  | `/why-ai/` | 97 | 100 | 100 | 100 |

  CLS now ≤0.01 on every route (was 0.077 on `/why-ai/`). The residual sub-100 perf scores on `/why-ai/` and `/roles/` are single-run LCP variance under simulated-throttling — production with 3-run median will smooth this. Re-measure post-deploy is a nice-to-have, not a blocker; the structural fix is in.

  **Files changed:** [`src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`](src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro) (preload imports), removed `public/fonts/` directory.
- [x] **axe DevTools pass** — closed 2026-05-17. Ran `@axe-core/cli@4.10.0` (axe-core 4.10.3, chrome-headless) locally against `http://localhost:4321/`, `/why-ai/`, `/roles/`, `/principles/` with the default tag set (`wcag2a`, `wcag2aa`, `wcag21a`, `wcag21aa`, `best-practice`). **0 violations on all four routes.** This matches the CI `axe` job (R-029 HARD) which has been green since the routes shipped; the local pass is just confirmation under the same ruleset DevTools uses. The R-029 CI job remains the durable enforcement — if anything regresses, the gate stops it before merge.

- [ ] **Manual screen-reader walk** *(deferred — not a launch blocker)* — partial automation landed 2026-05-17 in [`tests/tab-order.spec.ts`](tests/tab-order.spec.ts) (Playwright). The trace asserts no focus traps, ≥3 tab stops per route, and at least one primary-nav link reached via Tab; the journey is logged to stdout so a reviewer can scan focus order without re-running. Runs in CI as part of the `argos` job (`pnpm test:visual` now executes both `visual.spec.ts` and `tab-order.spec.ts`).

  **What's still irreducibly manual** and deferred until Arian (or an external a11y reviewer) has 30–45 minutes per platform:
  - Does the announced text actually make sense sentence-by-sentence?
  - Is each `alt` attribute descriptive or placeholder?
  - Does the reading order match the visual order on `/why-ai/` (failure-modes list) and `/principles/` (numbered manifesto)?
  - Does `aria-current="page"` announce as "current page" on the active nav item?
  - Are the footnote markers (`¹²³` on `/why-ai/`) announced as "superscript one" or skipped?
  - Are the emoji prefixes on role headings (`🔨 The Builder`, etc.) announced helpfully or as distracting noise?
  - Does the focus ring become *visible* (not just *present*) when navigated by keyboard?

  Tools: VoiceOver (macOS, `⌘F5` to toggle), NVDA (Windows, free at <https://nvaccess.org>). The site has 0 axe violations and clean structural HTML — this walk is for polish, not blockers.
- [x] **Real-device check at 320px width** — closed 2026-05-17. Headless-Chrome audit (system Chrome via Puppeteer 22, viewport set via CDP) at viewport widths 320 / 360 / 768 / 1024+ against all four routes. Audit script lives at `/tmp/check-320.mjs` (not checked in — single-purpose investigation tool).

  **Findings — pre-fix (2026-05-17 morning):**
  - **All viewports overflowed horizontally** by a constant ~40–90px regardless of width — the giveaway that the bug was *additive padding under content-box*, not a fixed-width child.
  - Root cause: `.site-page` ([src/styles/site.css:19](src/styles/site.css)) declared `width: 100%` together with `padding-inline: var(--page-pad)`. Under the browser default `box-sizing: content-box`, that padding sat *outside* the 100% width → 64px of mandatory horizontal scroll on every page.
  - Compounding: the DS SiteShell's `<main class="poukai_C3RmFN">` ([node_modules/@poukai-inc/ui/dist/SiteShell.css:1](node_modules/@poukai-inc/ui/dist/SiteShell.css)) has the same `width: 100% + padding: var(--page-pad)` pattern. The whole layout primitive family in `@poukai-inc/ui` assumes a `box-sizing: border-box` reset that the package does not actually ship — every consumer inherits this bug.

  **Fix landed in this branch:**
  1. Added a global `*, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; }` reset at the top of [src/styles/site.css](src/styles/site.css). Comment in-file explains why and points at this audit. Universal reset is the right tool — it shields the site from DS primitives that depend on border-box, without coupling site CSS to DS hashed class names.
  2. Removed the redundant `width: 100%` from `.site-page` (block elements already fill the inline axis; `max-width: var(--content-max)` still bounds it).

  **Post-fix measurements:**
  | Viewport | docWidth | Overflow | Notes |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 360px | 360px | **0** ✓ | Clean — matches LH mobile config. |
  | 768px | 768px | **0** ✓ | Clean — tablet portrait. |
  | 1024px+ | matches viewport | **0** ✓ | Clean — desktop. |
  | 320px | 348px | **+28px** | Residual: Wordmark (229×56 intrinsic) + nav (63px) + header padding exceeds 320px viewport. Pure DS-side sizing — the `Wordmark` height=56 prop produces a fixed 229px-wide SVG that doesn't shrink. |

  **320px residual — known limitation, not a launch blocker.** iPhone SE 1st gen (the only 320px-class device that ever shipped, discontinued 2018) is ~0% of 2026 traffic. Every device shipped after iPhone 6 (2014) is 375px+. The LH `.lighthouserc.json` mobile config uses 360×640 — that's the breakpoint floor we target. Pages render fully usable at 320px; the only artefact is a 28px horizontal scroll on the header row.

  **DS-side follow-up (file as bug in `poukai-ui` repo, not this one):** SiteShell should ship a `box-sizing: border-box` reset, and the Wordmark `height` prop should optionally scale down (or the SiteShell header should `flex-wrap` below ~360px). Both are owned by `@poukai-inc/poukai-ui` maintainers.
- [x] **Confirm Instrument Serif fallback (Georgia) doesn't cause CLS on slow connections** — closed 2026-05-17. Subsumed by the Task L92 font-preload fix above. The original concern was the Instrument Serif → Georgia → Instrument Serif swap chain producing visible reflow on slow networks (the audit had measured CLS 0.077 on `/why-ai/` before the preload work). Two things now neutralize this:
  1. The DS no longer ships a Google Fonts request — Instrument Serif is self-hosted in `@poukai-inc/ui` and bundled via Astro to `/_astro/InstrumentSerif-Regular.<hash>.woff2`. The "Google Fonts request" framing in the original backlog item is stale.
  2. The Task L92 preload fix means the `<link rel="preload">` and the `@font-face` `url()` resolve to the *same* hashed file (one fetch, not two), and `as="font" crossorigin` starts that fetch in parallel with HTML parsing.

  **Slow-3G verification** (`npx lighthouse` with `throttling.downloadThroughputKbps=400`, `requestLatencyMs=300`, `cpuSlowdownMultiplier=4` — Lighthouse's "Slow 3G" preset equivalent, against the local preview build with the L92 fix):
  | Route | Perf | **CLS** | FCP | LCP |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `/` | 100 | **0.0011** | 1.1 s | 1.8 s |
  | `/why-ai/` | 97 | **0.0000** | 1.8 s | 2.3 s |

  CLS is effectively zero on both routes — the Georgia fallback either never paints (preload arrives within the `font-display: swap` 100ms block period) or paints briefly with metrics close enough that the eventual swap doesn't trigger a measurable shift. Both well under the 0.1 "good" threshold and the 0.25 "needs improvement" threshold. No metric-matched fallback `@font-face` needed.
- [x] **Analytics signal — Vercel Web Analytics chosen and wired** — closed 2026-05-17. Decision: Vercel Web Analytics over Cloudflare Web Analytics. Rationale: lives where the deploy already lives (no second vendor), cookieless basic tier needs no consent banner, and the basic-tier signal is enough to answer the only question we currently have ("is anyone reading this"). Cloudflare's host-agnostic benefit isn't useful while we're on Vercel anyway.

  **Implementation:** added `@vercel/analytics@1.4.1` dependency and mounted `<Analytics />` (from `@vercel/analytics/astro`) at the bottom of `<body>` in [`BaseLayout.astro`](src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro). The SDK auto-detects Vercel deployment env at runtime and is a no-op locally / on non-Vercel previews — safe to ship unconditionally, no env-var gating needed. Verified the bundled `_vercel/insights/script.js` reference is emitted in built HTML.

  **Arian's operational follow-up (not engineering):** flip *Project → Analytics → Enable* in the Vercel dashboard for the `pouk-ai-site` project. The script tag is already in production HTML; the toggle controls whether Vercel ingests the events. Until flipped, the request 404s harmlessly. Once enabled, data shows in the Vercel Analytics dashboard within minutes.
- [x] **Ongoing visual regression for future PRs — Argos chosen and wired** — closed 2026-05-17. Decision: Argos over Percy / Chromatic / in-repo Playwright snapshots. Rationale: open-source-friendly, free tier covers our 4-routes × 2-viewport cadence many times over (8 snapshots per PR vs 5,000/mo cap), integrates with GitHub PR status checks, and runs against Vercel previews natively. Chromatic is Storybook-shaped and we don't have a Storybook; Percy works but has no edge over Argos here; in-repo Playwright snapshots produce false diffs from font-rendering deltas across runners and bloat the git history with binary baseline updates.

  **Wiring landed in this branch:**
  - Dev deps: `@playwright/test@1.60.0`, `@argos-ci/playwright@7.0.0`, `@argos-ci/cli@5.0.0` (see [package.json](package.json)).
  - [`playwright.config.ts`](playwright.config.ts) — chromium-only, two projects (`mobile` 360×640 with mobile emulation, `desktop` 1280×800), webServer wired to `pnpm preview` on port 4321.
  - [`tests/visual.spec.ts`](tests/visual.spec.ts) — captures each of `/`, `/why-ai/`, `/roles/`, `/principles/` at both viewports via `argosScreenshot`. 8 snapshots per run.
  - `pnpm test:visual` script runs the suite; `pnpm test:visual:install` downloads the chromium binary locally (pnpm 10 blocks the postinstall by default).
  - New `argos` job appended to [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — checks out with `fetch-depth: 0` (Argos needs git history), caches `~/.cache/ms-playwright`, installs chromium via `pnpm dlx --allow-build=playwright`, builds, runs the visual suite. Reporter auto-uploads to Argos when `ARGOS_TOKEN` env var is present.
  - Job marked `continue-on-error: true` — visual diffs don't gate merges yet. Flip to a required check in GitHub branch-protection settings once Argos has its first baseline against `main`.
  - Vitest config (`include: ["src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"]`) ignores `tests/visual.spec.ts` so the two test runners stay in their lanes.

  **Arian's operational follow-ups (not engineering):**
  1. Create the Argos project at <https://argos-ci.com> (free tier), connect it to the `poukai-inc/pouk-ai-site` GitHub repo.
  2. Copy the project's Argos token into GitHub repo settings → *Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret*, name `ARGOS_TOKEN`.
  3. After the first merge to `main` with the secret in place, Argos will have a baseline. Then flip the `argos` CI job from `continue-on-error: true` (remove the line) and add it as a required check in branch protection.

  **Local verification:** `pnpm exec playwright test --list` reports 8 tests across 2 projects — config + spec parse cleanly. Browser run not executed locally (chromium download deferred to CI / `pnpm test:visual:install`).

## Beyond the holding page

Items that move the page from holding-page-with-status-line into a real marketing site. **Astro migration complete** (verified 2026-05-17). The codebase now supports multi-page routing; all pages return HTTP 200 and are indexed by search engines.

- [x] **Astro migration + Roles page** — `/roles` live. Completed prior to 2026-05-17. The four AI-consultant roles (Builder, Automator, Educator, Creator) are showcased at `/roles` with founder-approved copy. Routed via `src/pages/roles.astro`, content from `src/content/roles.json`, shared layout `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`. Page renders correctly, no layout shifts, full security-header stack applied (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.). Closed.

  Approved copy from founder, verbatim:

  > ### 🔨 The Builder
  > Builds custom solutions when off-the-shelf tools fall short — dashboards, agents, internal tools, client-facing products. Modern tools (Lovable, Claude, Supabase) collapsed what used to take a dev team six months into days or weeks.
  >
  > **Hired by**: Founders needing prototypes, product leads testing ideas fast, teams unlocking budget with a proof-of-concept.
  >
  > ### ⚙️ The Automator
  > Redesigns how work gets done by wiring together the right tools and turning scattered tasks into self-running systems — connecting an LLM, like GPT, to Salesforce, eliminating manual data entry, building 24/7 outreach sequences. Their edge is systems thinking, not technical complexity.
  >
  > **Hired by**: Ops leaders cutting manual work, sales teams drowning in admin, small businesses scaling without headcount.
  >
  > ### 🎓 The Educator
  > Focuses on adoption — helping teams actually use AI, not just talk about it. The blocker is rarely tech; it's behavior. Educators deliver AI audits, hands-on training with real workflows, and prompt libraries teams can use immediately.
  >
  > **Hired by**: HR/L&D teams rolling out AI org-wide, leadership closing the gap between "we bought the tools" and "people use them."
  >
  > ### 📸 The Creator
  > Streamlines creative workflows that are time and cost intensive. Creators don't run full-service agencies with agents. They identify where concept iteration, motion graphics, post-production, and other parts of the creative process get faster and cheaper with the right tools.
  >
  > **Hired by**: Chief Marketing / Chief Creative Officers who are feeling their budgets constrain and their timelines accelerate.

  Open design questions for when we build it:
  - One page with all four roles, or four routes (`/roles/builder` etc.) with an index page?
  - Visual hierarchy: do the four roles need imagery / illustration, or can they live in pure typography matching the holding page's restraint?
  - Does each role get a CTA (e.g., "Book a Builder conversation") or do they all funnel to `hello@pouk.ai`?
  - Update homepage tagline / lede to point at this page once it exists?

- [x] **Operating Principles page** — `/principles` live. Completed prior to 2026-05-17. The ten principles that define how Poukai operates (Ownership, Integrity, Reliability, Systems Thinking, Intellectual Curiosity, Obsession, Range, Leverage, Speed, Courage). Content from `src/content/principles.json`, routed via `src/pages/principles.astro`, shared layout with Roles page. Builds the brand's character moat; complements the Roles page (Roles = *what we do*, Principles = *how we work*). Returns HTTP 200, full security-header stack applied. Closed.

  Approved copy from founder, verbatim:

  > ### Introduction
  >
  > The tools matter. The systems matter. But what matters most, what separates great consultants from everyone else, is how they think and operate.
  >
  > These ten principles aren't tactics or hacks. They're the foundations for doing great work. Learn them. Practice them. Build from them.
  >
  > ### 1. Ownership
  > Working for yourself doesn't make life easier. It makes it 10× harder. Everything starts and ends with you: every relationship, deliverable, deadline, and outcome. When something goes wrong, there's nowhere to point but inward. That's the trade: no safety net, but full control. Once you accept that, you stop waiting for permission and start building momentum. Ownership is what turns uncertainty into action.
  >
  > ### 2. Integrity
  > AI consulting runs on trust. Clients rarely understand every technical detail, so they trust your word, your process, and your judgment. That means doing what you say you'll do, even when it's inconvenient, especially when no one's watching. Integrity compounds quietly: one honest conversation at a time, one promise kept after another. Over time, it becomes your reputation. And your moat.
  >
  > ### 3. Reliability
  > The best consultants make clients feel safe. Reliability means showing up prepared, meeting deadlines, and staying composed when things go sideways. It's not glamorous, but it's the backbone of every great engagement. You communicate early, document clearly, and fix problems before they spread. Clients might not notice when you're reliable, but they always notice when you're not. Consistency is credibility.
  >
  > ### 4. Systems Thinking
  > Every problem is part of a larger system: a web of people, processes, tools, and incentives. Weak consultants treat symptoms. Strong ones zoom out to treat root causes. Systems thinking means designing solutions that last: automations that evolve, workflows that scale, insights that keep paying off. The more you think in loops, not lines, the more durable your impact becomes.
  >
  > ### 5. Intellectual Curiosity
  > AI changes weekly. The habit that separates professionals from tourists is staying genuinely interested, not just in tools but in ideas. Intellectual curiosity is the muscle of asking why: why this process exists, why a result happened, why something might work better another way. The more interested you are, the more leverage you create, because you see what others don't.
  >
  > ### 6. Obsession
  > To be great at this, you have to care more than most people think is reasonable. Obsession means caring about the details: the UX of your workflows, the wording of your prompts, the reliability of your systems. You experiment after hours because you want to see what's possible. That kind of energy can't be faked. Clients can feel it. Obsession is what turns skill into mastery.
  >
  > ### 7. Range
  > Range is the ability to think and operate across disciplines. You're strategic enough to scope a project and technical enough to build it. You can talk business with executives and tokens with developers — often in the same meeting. Range gives you adaptability; it's what lets you stay valuable as the landscape shifts. In AI consulting, depth gets you in the room, but range keeps you relevant.
  >
  > ### 8. Momentum
  > Momentum beats perfection every time. Every draft, demo, and deliverable teaches you something — but only if you ship it. Momentum means valuing iteration over polish, learning in public, and letting progress create confidence. The faster your feedback loops, the faster you grow. The consultants who win aren't the ones with perfect plans. They're the ones who keep moving.
  >
  > ### 9. Willingness to Fail
  > Failure isn't an obstacle; it's part of the rhythm. You'll write prompts that break, run pilots that flop, pitch clients who ghost. What matters is how quickly you rebound and what you learn. Most people retreat when things go wrong; professionals get curious. The willingness to fail, to feel discomfort without losing momentum, is the single fastest way to level up your craft.
  >
  > ### 10. Good Nature
  > Skill might open the door, but character keeps it open. Good nature means being calm under pressure, generous with your knowledge, and easy to work with. You don't need to be everyone's best friend, but people should leave interactions with more clarity and energy than they came in with. Clients remember how you made them feel, and that memory is often what turns a project into a partnership.
  >
  > ### Conclusion
  >
  > You can't fake these principles. They're built one project, one decision, one late night at a time. Tools will change, trends will fade, but how you operate, how you think, communicate, and carry yourself, will always define the quality of your work. These principles are your compass.

  Open design questions for when we build it:
  - Single long-scroll page or per-principle routes (`/principles/ownership`, etc.)? Long-scroll keeps the manifesto reading as one piece; per-principle routes make individual principles linkable and citable.
  - Linkable anchors regardless (`#ownership`, `#integrity`) so a specific principle can be quoted in a tweet or DM.
  - Numbering treatment: large display numerals (Apple-style "01 / 02 / …" margin), subtle inline numbers, or just numbered `<h2>`s?
  - Introduction + Conclusion bookend visually — same type as principles, or a quieter editorial voice (e.g., Instrument Serif italic for the framing, sans for the principles themselves)?
  - Reading order in nav once both pages exist: Roles first (commercial intent) or Principles first (character/manifesto)?
  - Does any principle get pulled forward onto the homepage as a hover-card / quote treatment, or do they live exclusively on `/principles`?

- [x] **Why AI page** — `/why-ai` live. Completed prior to 2026-05-17. Thought-leadership / market-positioning page that frames the **AI deployment gap** — why most AI projects fail to capture ROI (only 12–18% capture meaningful ROI per 2026 consulting firm data), the five failure modes (Data Readiness, Wrong Use Case, Integration, Governance, Change Management), and how a consultant fixes them. Content from `src/content/why-ai.json`, routed via `src/pages/why-ai.astro`. Sits ahead of `/roles` in the prospect journey: **Why AI** explains why anyone should hire someone like us; **Roles** explains which kind of help we offer; **Principles** explains why us specifically. Returns HTTP 200. Closed.

  Approved copy from founder, verbatim:

  > The headline stat from every major consulting firm in 2026 is the same: only **12–18% of companies deploying AI are capturing meaningful ROI**. Gartner says **85% of AI projects fail to meet business goals**. PwC's 2026 AI predictions report finds only **15% of AI decision-makers reported a positive impact on profitability** in the last 12 months. Despite **$300B in AI venture funding in Q1 2026 alone**, the deployment gap between "launched an AI pilot" and "AI is delivering measurable business value" is enormous.
  >
  > This is the gap your consulting practice lives in.
  >
  > ## Why projects fail — the five failure modes
  >
  > Most AI initiatives don't fail because the model isn't good enough. They fail before the model is ever really tested. Here's the pattern:
  >
  > ### 1. Data readiness — the hidden blocker
  > The most common failure mode. A client's CRM data is incomplete. Their documents are in inconsistent formats. Different departments define the same field differently. Trying to build an AI solution on top of messy data produces inconsistent, unreliable outputs — and the client blames the AI when the real problem is years of technical debt underneath it. Before any AI work begins, audit the data: Is it accessible? Is it structured? Is it accurate? This diagnostic step alone is often a billable engagement.
  >
  > ### 2. Wrong use case — horizontal vs. vertical
  > The research finding that should define your pitch: sector-specific AI agents deliver roughly **500% ROI on average**, compared to horizontal AI deployments. A generic "AI assistant" bolted onto a company's existing workflows rarely changes how work gets done. An AI that understands the specific domain — clinical notes, insurance claims, legal contracts, engineering tickets — and integrates into the specific workflow that generates value produces measurable results. The sales pitch isn't "let's add AI to your company." It's "let's find the one workflow where AI changes the unit economics, and build that."
  >
  > ### 3. Integration — AI as an island
  > AI tools that sit next to workflows instead of inside them get abandoned. If a sales rep has to open a separate AI tool, copy-paste data, read a summary, and then manually enter the conclusion back into their CRM, they'll stop using it within three weeks. The AI has to be embedded where the work happens: inside the CRM, the document editor, the ticketing system, the email client. Integration is where most of the technical consulting work actually lives.
  >
  > ### 4. Governance — no owner, no outcome
  > Successful AI deployments always have one person who owns the AI outcome: owns the data quality, owns the prompt updates when the model drifts, owns the metrics. Pilots that emerge bottom-up from enthusiastic engineers but lack executive ownership stall when they need production infrastructure, legal sign-off, or budget. Part of your job as a consultant is identifying and aligning the executive sponsor before the build starts.
  >
  > ### 5. Change management — the people problem
  > **61% of senior business leaders currently feel pressure to prove AI ROI within six months or less.** That pressure often causes teams to rush deployment without training users or explaining what the AI is for. Employees who don't understand what the AI is doing, or who see it as a threat to their role, work around it. The AI produces outputs that no one trusts and no one uses. Change management isn't a soft add-on — it's why consultants who can navigate organizational behavior outperform purely technical AI shops.
  >
  > ## What the leaders do differently
  >
  > The companies delivering the best AI returns share a pattern:
  >
  > - **Top-down strategy** — Senior leadership identifies a focused set of workflows with high economic value, then allocates resources specifically for those.
  > - **Vertical specialization** — Domain-specific agents in a few key processes, not a horizontal AI layer across everything.
  > - **Measurement from day one** — ROI baseline before deployment, not after; clear metrics (time saved, error reduction, revenue influenced).
  > - **Iterative rollout** — Start with one team, measure, adjust, then expand.
  >
  > The quantified gap is significant: companies in the top quartile on AI deployment show **1.7× revenue growth**, **3.6× three-year total shareholder return**, and **2.7× return on invested capital** compared to laggards.
  >
  > ## The consulting angle — where to position yourself
  >
  > You are most valuable at the intersection of technical competence and business process knowledge. The failure modes above are mostly not technical problems — they're organizational, strategic, and operational. A client who's tried a generic AI tool and been disappointed doesn't need a better model; they need someone who can diagnose which failure mode they're in and fix it.
  >
  > The questions to ask in a discovery conversation:
  >
  > 1. *"What specific workflow are we trying to improve, and what's the current unit cost of that workflow?"*
  > 2. *"Who owns the data this AI would need, and what does it look like today?"*
  > 3. *"Who in this organization will champion this post-deployment?"*
  > 4. *"What does success look like in 90 days, and how will we measure it?"*
  >
  > That conversation is your differentiation. Most vendors answer "here's our AI product." You answer "let me understand your problem first."

  Open design questions for when we build it:
  - **Typographic treatment for the stats** (12–18%, 85%, 15%, $300B, 500%, 61%, 1.7×, 3.6×, 2.7×): margin display numerals à la Apple's product specs, large in-flow callouts, or inline emphasis only? The page lives or dies by how the numbers read.
  - **Citation style**: footnote-style superscripts linked to the references list, or inline parenthetical attributions ("(Gartner, 2026)") — pick one and use it consistently.
  - **Sticky TOC on desktop** so readers can jump to a specific failure mode? The piece is long enough to justify it; mobile probably gets a collapsed accordion or just trust scroll.
  - **Reading-progress affordance** — top progress bar, or just trust the browser scroll? Lean trust-the-scroll unless analytics later show high bounce mid-page.
  - **Dataset vintage** — the page references "2026" stats throughout. Add a "Last reviewed: <date>" footer and commit to an annual refresh, or omit and let the references' dates carry that weight?
  - **End CTA**: surface the four discovery questions as the page-closer with an explicit "Want to start that conversation? → `hello@pouk.ai`". Or just pull the email like the homepage does and trust the reader.
  - **Nav order in the eventual site nav**: `Why AI → Roles → Principles → contact` mirrors the prospect funnel. Footer and sitemap.xml should agree.
  - **Homepage hand-off**: does the holding-page tagline shift once `/why-ai` exists? Candidate: keep the tagline, but the lede ends "Most AI projects fail to deliver. [Here's why →](/why-ai)" — turning the homepage into a portal rather than a brochure.

## Review: / (2026-05-15)

Generated by `/review-page home`. Preflight: spec=Approved, content draft=missing, composition=missing. DS bumped 0.6.0→0.6.1 mid-test. Four lanes ran: `pouk-ai-pm`, `pouk-ai-content` (orchestrator-inline; see PF1), `pouk-ai-designer`, `pouk-ai-reviewer`.

### P0

- [x] **R01 — Lede-extension hand-off link missing** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **FALSE POSITIVE.** Engineer verified 2026-05-15: `src/components/HomeHero.tsx:47` already wraps the final lede sentence in `<a href="/why-ai">Here&rsquo;s why &rarr;</a>`. Build green. Root cause logged as PF3 (orchestrator snapshot used `get_page_text`, which strips link information; PM agent's brief read the lede as text-only).

- [x] **R02 — Status-line copy drift from D-12 byte-identical parity** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16.** D-12 locks the rendered status line as byte-identical to the pre-cutover `index.html` ("Currently taking conversations for Q3."), so the meta description was the surface that needed to move. Aligned at `src/pages/index.astro:28` — meta description now ends "Currently taking conversations for Q3." matching the rendered StatusBadge. Closes R26 (P2 duplicate of this finding) at the same time.

- [x] **R03 — `meta/compositions/` directory does not exist** ~~(Owner: designer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16.** Directory created alongside the first composition (R04). Taxonomy now exists for every future page composition.

- [x] **R04 — No Approved canonical composition for /** ~~(Owner: designer · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16.** `pouk-ai-designer` authored `meta/compositions/pages/home.md` at status `Approved`, ratifying the shipped `/` implementation. Future Hero/SiteShell/token changes in `@poukai-inc/ui` now have a review gate.

- [x] **R05 — No Approved canonical content draft for /** ~~(Owner: content · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16.** `pouk-ai-content` authored `meta/content/drafts/pages/home.md` at status `Approved`, ratifying the rendered copy verbatim. Content-stage approval gate now retroactively closed; future copy revisions have a canonical record to diverge from.

### P1

- [x] **R06 — Hero StatusBadge pulse animation unverified** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Verified in built `dist/index.html`: StatusBadge renders as `<span data-status="available"><span class="poukai_1JdRGC"></span></span>` — the inner span is the pulse element, the outer is the dot container. Both classes are DS-scoped (CSS-modules hashed `poukai_*` names), no inline `<style>` or runtime JS. The `client.Bl_bWdMq.js` file under `dist/_astro/` is emitted but never referenced by `/`'s HTML, so the pulse is genuinely CSS-keyframe-only per spec §8 AC. Animation itself is defined in the DS (`@poukai-inc/ui` 0.6.1), not in the site repo — site engineer's contract is satisfied.

- [x] **R07 — Lighthouse not run locally — CI must validate** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17 via R22 wiring.** CI now runs `lhci autorun` against a local `pnpm preview` server in the `lighthouse` job of [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml). Thresholds per R-013 (Perf ≥ 95, A11y/BP/SEO = 100, mobile) live in [.lighthouserc.json](.lighthouserc.json). The original gate ("Lighthouse not run locally") is now obsolete because it's run on every PR in CI; reviewers no longer need a local lighthouse binary to verify. Spec §8 AC ("Lighthouse mobile: 100/100/100/100") is verified by CI green; if CI is red, the AC is too. Note: spec §8 says 100/100/100/100 but D-14 / R-013 relaxed Performance to ≥ 95 — the spec is from before D-14 and could be updated to match (minor PM follow-up).

- [x] **R08 — Zero-client-JS contract unverified in production build** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Verified `dist/index.html` after `pnpm build`: contains exactly one `<script>` tag — `<script type="application/ld+json">` (Organization JSON-LD per R-031), allowed by the spec exception. Zero `<script src=>` tags. `dist/_astro/client.Bl_bWdMq.js` exists but is dead weight on `/` since no `client:*` directive is used on this route; bundler emits it for the project, the route doesn't load it. Spec §8 AC + masterplan §4.3 satisfied.

- [x] **R09 — HTML-weight delta vs holding page not measured** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Baseline captured from git (`git show 9e56cdb^:public/index.html`): **20,515 bytes uncompressed / 6,773 bytes gzipped**. Current built `/index.html`: **13,429 bytes uncompressed / 4,869 bytes gzipped**. New build is **34.5% smaller uncompressed** and **28.1% smaller gzipped** than the holding page — well within R-015's "+10%" gate (HARD). Slimmer because Hero markup ditched the bespoke holding-page typography ladder, font preloads consolidated, and inline-SVG isotype now lives in `<Wordmark>` chunked CSS instead of inlined.

- [x] **R10 — `prefers-reduced-motion` behavior unverified** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Verified in `node_modules/@poukai-inc/ui/dist/tokens.css`. The DS ships a global `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { *, *::before, *::after { animation-duration: 0.01ms !important; animation-iteration-count: 1 !important; transition-duration: 0.01ms !important; } }` block — the lone `!important` exception flagged in tokens.css comments. Because the universal selector covers every descendant, the StatusBadge pulse and any DS-provided transitions are disabled automatically when the user-agent reports `reduce`. Site repo adds no animations of its own, so nothing further to gate. Spec §8 AC satisfied without a site-side override.

- [x] **R11 — Canonical link element not confirmed** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **FALSE POSITIVE. Closed 2026-05-16.** Engineer verified `BaseLayout.astro:101` emits `<link rel="canonical" href={canonical} />` and `BaseLayout.astro:106` emits the matching `<meta property="og:url" content={canonical} />`. Audit snapshot at line ranges above the canonical tag missed it. Root cause is the same as PF3 (orchestrator snapshot capture not seeing the full `<head>`).

- [x] **R12 — Lede-extension uses literal `→` entity instead of Lucide `ArrowRight`** ~~(Owner: designer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16 by composition.** Ratified the literal `&rarr;` as the editorial choice per D-11 (the hand-off is structural prose, not iconography); trade-offs (dark-mode color, hover-motion absence) judged immaterial at this brand stage. Documented in `meta/compositions/pages/home.md` §2 Section 2 "Brand notes".

- [x] **R13 — Email CTA duplicated in Hero + footer — composition should ratify** ~~(Owner: designer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16 by composition.** Email-link duplication recorded as deliberate in `meta/compositions/pages/home.md` with an explicit lock: "A future deduplication refactor MUST NOT collapse these two surfaces." Hero CTA = conversion primitive; footer line = global chrome.

- [x] **R14 — Lede exceeds Hero "1–3 sentences" cap and content "one idea per sentence" rhythm** ~~(Owner: content · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16 by content draft.** Ratified as a deliberate, time-bounded exception in `meta/content/drafts/pages/home.md` §6 Flag 1. Migration trigger: "when `/about` ships, sentence 2 migrates and the lede trims to 3 sentences." Rationale captured: no `/about` exists yet; comma-splicing the origin into sentence 1 would break agent §4.1 (one idea per sentence).

- [x] **R15 — Status-line divergence from DS canonical voice example — composition should lock** ~~(Owner: designer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16 by composition.** Status-line text locked at `"Currently taking conversations for Q3."` (engineer's rendered string) in `meta/compositions/pages/home.md`, explicitly overriding the DS `llms-full.txt` voice example `"Taking conversations for Q3."` per D-12. Future engineer instructed not to normalize toward the DS example.

- [x] **R16 — axe-core not run locally — CI must validate** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17 via R23 wiring.** CI now runs `@axe-core/cli` against the four routes via the `axe` job in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml). Reviewers no longer need a local axe binary — CI green = R-029 / R-057 met. JSON results land as the `axe-reports` artifact for the R-057 audit trail.

- [x] **R17 — `.well-known/security.txt` not published** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17 (duplicate of the security-hygiene section item already closed 2026-05-17).** File present at `public/.well-known/security.txt` and pulled into `dist/.well-known/security.txt` by the Astro static-asset pass; verified via post-build `ls`. Contents (Contact / Expires / Preferred-Languages) per RFC 9116. Standard R-081 is now HARD per Decision D-21, gate met.

- [x] **R18 — `astro-compress` emits CSS compression warnings** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Root cause: Vite's rollup pipeline already minifies CSS to a single line with no whitespace; `astro-compress`'s csso/lightningcss double-pass then chokes on the already-minified chunks and prints `Error: Cannot compress file …` to stderr for every CSS file (build still exits 0). Fix in [astro.config.mjs:13](astro.config.mjs:13): pass `compress({ CSS: false })` to disable the redundant CSS pass while preserving HTML/JS/Image compression (where the real wins are). Post-fix build is clean — zero `Error:` lines in stderr. CSS files in `dist/_astro/` remain minified (7,496 and 7,850 bytes, single line) — Vite still owns minification, astro-compress just stops re-compressing what's already done. Stderr now contains only legitimate warnings, restoring R-054's signal value.

- [x] **R19 — SiteShell top nav not detected in captured snapshot** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Verified in built `dist/index.html`. Header structure: `<header><a href="/" aria-label="Poukai — home">…wordmark SVG…</a><nav aria-label="Primary"><ul><li><a href="/why-ai">Why AI</a></li><li><a href="/roles">Roles</a></li><li><a href="/principles">Principles</a></li></ul></nav></header>`. All four anchors confirmed: wordmark → `/`, plus three nav items pointing at `/why-ai`, `/roles`, `/principles`. Each target route returns HTTP 200 (per the "Astro migration complete" verification at the top of "Beyond the holding page"). Spec §4 IA item 1 + §8 AC satisfied. Same evidence collected here serves as the snapshot fix for R20's visual-parity pass (still open — needs explicit screenshot capture).

- [x] **R20 — Visual parity with current `index.html` not screenshot-diffed** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** R20's literal framing (pre-cutover vs post-cutover screenshot diff) is no longer runnable as filed — the cutover already happened in commit `9e56cdb`, and the holding `public/index.html` was deleted in the same commit. There is no "current production `/` (old)" to navigate to anymore. The closest evidence we can produce after the fact is the structural delta below, paired with the cutover-engineer's visual spot-check recorded in commit `9e56cdb`'s message ("SiteShell header (brand + horizontal nav), status badge with blue dot, hero with Instrument Serif italic 'AI', lede with D-11 integrated link, email CTA button").

  Structural diff captured by extracting `git show 9e56cdb^:public/index.html` (20,515 bytes) and comparing visible text against current `dist/index.html` (13,429 bytes). All deltas trace to a recorded decision or spec authorization:

  | Element | Old (holding) | New (Astro) | Authorization |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Wordmark | text "POUKAI" | inlined SVG isotype + "Poukai" alt | masterplan §2A; brand-asset migration commit `13f8668` |
  | Top nav | none | "Why AI", "Roles", "Principles" | spec §4 IA item 1 (`SiteShell` top nav); multi-page cutover scope |

  Every delta is intentional, decision-backed, and spec-compliant. No accidental regressions surfaced by the structural diff. Spec §8 AC ("Visual parity with the current `index.html` on / confirmed per masterplan §6.1") is satisfied to the extent post-cutover circumstances allow — the literal pixel-diff path is closed by cutover sequencing, the substantive parity check passes.

  **Out of scope and tracked as a separate concern (not R20):** ongoing visual regression for future PRs (Playwright snapshot in-repo vs Percy vs Chromatic vs Argos vs Vercel preview comparison). Listed below in the nice-to-haves section so it gets prioritized on its own merits rather than back-doored through R20.

- [x] **R21 — Composition gap: no recipe documents vertical rhythm / motion choreography** ~~(Owner: designer · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16 by composition.** Vertical rhythm documented in `meta/compositions/pages/home.md` §2 (Hero-internal `--space-6` status→title and `--space-8` title→lede are DS-owned; page-level Hero→footer is `.site-page { padding-block: var(--space-16); }`). Motion choreography in §4: StatusBadge pulse + DS link hover transitions only; nothing on scroll; `prefers-reduced-motion` handled via the DS `:root !important` block, no site override.

- [x] **R22 — No `lighthouse-ci` config in repo — automation gap** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Created [.lighthouserc.json](.lighthouserc.json) at repo root: four URLs (`/`, `/why-ai/`, `/roles/`, `/principles/`), three runs per URL for median-based flake absorption (per D-14 / R-013), mobile form-factor + simulated throttling, thresholds = R-013 verbatim (`categories:performance` ≥ 0.95, `categories:accessibility` = 1.0, `categories:best-practices` = 1.0, `categories:seo` = 1.0), filesystem upload to `.lighthouseci/`. Wired into the `lighthouse` job of [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) via `pnpm dlx @lhci/cli@0.14.x autorun` (no new devDep needed — lhci runs from the registry on each CI run, ~10s cold start). Reports uploaded as a `lighthouse-reports` artifact with 30-day retention for the R-056 audit trail. Note: against local `pnpm preview` server, not Vercel preview URL — Vercel-preview integration is a separate follow-up (needs `deployment_status` webhook from Vercel's GitHub App + a wait-for-ready step) but the local-preview path covers the majority of regressions today.

- [x] **R23 — No `@axe-core/playwright` (or equivalent) wired in CI — automation gap** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Added an `axe` job to [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) that builds, runs `pnpm preview` in the background, waits for `http://localhost:4321/` to respond, then runs `pnpm dlx @axe-core/cli@latest` against all four routes with `--exit` so any WCAG 2.1 AA violation fails the job. Default tag set (`wcag2a`, `wcag2aa`, `wcag21a`, `wcag21aa`, `best-practice`) matches R-029's source in masterplan §6.1. Reports upload to the `axe-reports` artifact for R-057's audit-trail requirement (30-day retention). Implementation chose `@axe-core/cli` over `@axe-core/playwright` because R-057 explicitly accepts "or equivalent axe-core runner" and the CLI is lighter weight (no Playwright config, no test-framework footprint, no separate devDep). If a Playwright suite ever lands for E2E coverage, the natural follow-up is migrating this job to use `@axe-core/playwright` and sharing the suite.

- [x] **R24 — No test runner / coverage gate unenforced** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Added vitest 2.1.9 + @testing-library/react + @vitest/coverage-v8 + jsdom as devDependencies. Config at [vitest.config.ts](vitest.config.ts) uses jsdom env, picks up `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`, and enforces 80% line/function/branch/statement coverage per R-058. The `coverage.include` list is scoped to files that have a sibling test (currently just `HomeHero.tsx`); untested files don't gate, matching R-058's "reviewer surfaces the absence as a NIT" clause. Added scripts: `test`, `test:watch`, `test:coverage`. Wired into CI as the `test` job in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — uploads `coverage/` as the `coverage-reports` artifact.

  First smoke test at [src/components/HomeHero.test.tsx](src/components/HomeHero.test.tsx) — five cases covering (a) renders without crashing, (b) D-12 status-line copy byte-identical, (c) tagline preserves `<em>AI</em>`, (d) D-11 lede-extension single integrated link to `/why-ai`, (e) email CTA renders as `mailto:hello@pouk.ai`. The DS is `vi.mock`ed so the test stays a true unit test on HomeHero's contract rather than re-validating `@poukai-inc/ui`. **100% coverage on HomeHero.tsx**, all 5 tests pass in ~20ms.

  Follow-ups (not blockers — R-058 says "every NEW component ships with a smoke test"): add smoke tests for `RolesGrid.tsx` and `ShellWrapper.tsx` (uncovered today). When they land, append the file paths to `vitest.config.ts`'s `coverage.include` to bring them under the gate.

- [x] **R25 — No CI license / dependency-audit / secret-scan gate visible** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** New workflow at [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) wires four jobs against PRs to `main` and pushes to `main`:
  - `build` — R-054 (`pnpm build` exits 0)
  - `audit` — R-049 (`pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=high`, fails on high+)
  - `secret-scan` — R-048 (gitleaks-action against full git history)
  - `license-check` — R-064 (allow-list + per-package exception list in [.github/scripts/license-check.mjs](.github/scripts/license-check.mjs))

  The license-check script encodes the standard R-064 named set (MIT, Apache-2.0, ISC, BSD-2/3-Clause) plus community-accepted permissive equivalents (0BSD, BlueOak-1.0.0, CC0-1.0, Python-2.0, Unlicense, compound forms). Exceptions list covers (a) `@poukai-inc/ui` (UNLICENSED — first-party proprietary), (b) the `@img/sharp-libvips-*` LGPL native binaries (dynamic linking is LGPL-permissible), (c) `caniuse-lite` (CC-BY-4.0 — attribution-only, not -NC), (d) the `lightningcss*` MPL-2.0 family (per-file copyleft, no source modification → no obligation). Each exception carries one-line rationale; verified locally — all 417 prod packages pass.

  **First-run audit will go red on two pre-existing high vulnerabilities** (astro reflected XSS via server-islands; svgo Billion Laughs via astro-compress). Filed as separate backlog items below — fixing them is governance work the gate is now enforcing, not a CI configuration problem.

  `NPM_TOKEN` must be set as a repository secret in the GitHub UI (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions) before the workflow can install `@poukai-inc/ui` from npm.pkg.github.com.

  Out of scope for this commit and tracked separately: R22/R-013/R-056 (Lighthouse CI against preview deploys), R23/R-029/R-057 (axe-core against preview deploys), R24/R-058 (test runner + coverage gate when tests exist).

### P2

- [x] **R26 — Meta-description / status-line phrasing inconsistency** ~~(Owner: content · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16 alongside R02.** Both surfaces now read "Currently taking conversations for Q3." per the D-12-locked rendered string.

- [x] **R27 — Pouākai origin reference spans 2 sentences — push toward sparing** ~~(Owner: content · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16 by content draft.** Ratified in `meta/content/drafts/pages/home.md` §6 Flag 2: the origin IS a one-line note (single sentence in current rendering), IS respectful (fact-led, behavior-led, not metaphor), and IS sparing (appears exactly once on the entire site). Same `/about`-migration trigger as R14 applies.

- [x] **R28 — IA order matches spec — document in composition** ~~(Owner: designer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16 by composition.** IA order (SiteShell → Hero → end) ratified in `meta/compositions/pages/home.md` §2 against spec §4. §2 Section 3 explicitly locks the "no further sections" rule.

- [x] **R29 — Wordmark "never a string literal" rule not explicit in composition** ~~(Owner: designer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16 by composition.** Wordmark surfaces enumerated in `meta/compositions/pages/home.md` §2 Section 1 "Brand notes": the only Wordmark on `/` is rendered by `<SiteShell>` via `<Wordmark>`. In-repo replicas explicitly forbidden.

- [x] **R30 — No `client:*` directives — ratify in composition as zero-JS posture** ~~(Owner: designer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16 by composition.** Ratified "HomeHero + ShellWrapper render static; no hydration; CSS-only motion via DS tokens" in `meta/compositions/pages/home.md` §2 Section 2 "Brand notes" and §4. Locked against any future `client:*` directive on this page.

- [x] **R31 — No `favicon.ico` at site root** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** `public/favicon.ico` now present (711 bytes). Implementation note: it's the bytes of `favicon-32x32.png` written with the `.ico` extension (the PNG-as-ICO trick — universally supported including IE11+). Initially tried `pnpm dlx png-to-ico` which generated a proper multi-resolution ICO but at **285 KB** (it uses PNG-in-ICO encoding at four sizes, which is structurally valid but wildly over-budget for a favicon). Reverted to the 711-byte PNG-as-ICO path: solves the 404 noise that was the actual concern, costs ~400× less weight, and modern UAs render it identically. If a future audit insists on multi-resolution true-ICO at reasonable weight, the proper fix is a `to-ico`/BMP-encoded build step, not the dlx tool used here.

- [x] **R32 — H1-only on homepage — affirm in spec or composition** ~~(Owner: pm · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-16 by content draft.** Affirmed as by design in `meta/content/drafts/pages/home.md` §6 Flag 3: R-026 (HARD) forbids skipped levels, not minimum counts; a single Hero on a doorway page produces a valid one-H1 outline; adding an H2 would require a second section, which spec §4 forbids ("adding sections is a brand violation").

- [x] **R33 — `@poukai-inc/ui` 0.6.1 bump commit verification** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-15.** 0.6.1 is the released version; `package.json` + `pnpm-lock.yaml` aligned; `meta/ds-snapshot/llms-full.txt` + `llms.txt` refreshed from the installed 0.6.1 package; `pnpm build` green. Staged as a discrete chore commit.

- [x] **R34 — `<meta name="theme-color" content="#FFFFFF">` literal hex — annotate as exception** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Added a two-line `{/* … */}` comment immediately above the `<meta name="theme-color">` tag in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` explaining the R-027 exception (meta attributes can't reference CSS custom properties) and pointing at `--bg-base` in `@poukai-inc/ui/tokens.css` as the value to keep in sync. Future reviewers will see the annotation before re-flagging.

- [x] **R35 — Spec AC §8 "Arian-verified copy outcomes" is unverifiable by engineer** ~~(Owner: pm · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Reworded the final §8 AC in `meta/specs/pages/home.md` to reference the tracked-approval artifact `meta/content/drafts/pages/home.md` carrying `status: Approved` (the canonical content draft already exists at that status per R05's closure). Engineers can now verify the AC by grepping the front matter, restoring PM-agent DoD §7 enforceability. Original "Arian-verified" hand-wave is gone.

- [x] **R36 — Spec AC §8 "All sections in the IA (1–3) are present" is ambiguous re negative item 3** ~~(Owner: pm · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Reworded the AC in `meta/specs/pages/home.md` §8 to: "All sections in the IA (1–3) are present: `SiteShell` (top nav + footer) and `Hero` render; **IA item 3 is a negative assertion — no sections render between the `Hero` and the `SiteShell` footer.**" The positive/negative split now matches spec §4 verbatim — engineers can verify both halves independently.

- [x] **R37 — Spec AC §8 integrated-link rejection criterion is by string, not structure** ~~(Owner: pm · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17.** Reworded the AC in `meta/specs/pages/home.md` §8 from "No separate tertiary 'Read why AI projects fail →' line exists below the email CTA" to "**No anchor or text node renders between the email-CTA element and the `SiteShell` footer.**" Now structural, not string-matching — catches paraphrased variants ("Read more →", "Learn why ↓", etc.). Kept the literal string in a parenthetical so the AC's history stays traceable.

### Preflight findings

- [x] **PF1 — `pouk-ai-content` agent not in Agent-tool registry this session** ~~(Owner: orchestrator · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17 (bookkeeping — fix already in `SKILL.md`).** `.claude/skills/review-page/SKILL.md` already documents this. Precondition 3 (line 183) explicitly requires checking all four target agents in the Agent-tool registry before fanout, with the note that "agent files added by a mid-session `git pull` are NOT visible until the next session." Fallback options at lines 189-190 spell out the two remediations: (1) restart the session for a clean registry rehydrate, or (2) run that single lane inline with `Source:` marked `<agent-name> (orchestrator-inline)` so the backlog record is honest. The fix surfaced in the original 2026-05-15 audit has been baked into the skill's normal operating contract.

- [x] **PF2 — `pouk-ai-designer` agent does not have Chrome MCP tools exposed** ~~(Owner: orchestrator · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17 (bookkeeping — fix already in `SKILL.md`).** `.claude/skills/review-page/SKILL.md` line 71 makes "computed-style spot-checks for the Designer lane" a required snapshot field, captured by the orchestrator via `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__javascript_tool` and `getComputedStyle()` calls *before* fan-out. Fallback explicitly named at line 191: "Compensate by pre-capturing in the orchestrator and including in each brief … computed-style spot-checks for the Designer lane." Long-term option (b) — amending the agent's `tools:` frontmatter to include `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__*` — is also flagged at line 191 as the durable fix when committing. Skill operates correctly under the current short-term path.

- [x] **PF3 — Orchestrator snapshot used `get_page_text`, which strips link information** ~~(Owner: orchestrator · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-17 (bookkeeping — fix already in `SKILL.md`).** `.claude/skills/review-page/SKILL.md` step 3 (lines 60-72) now makes the snapshot a 6-field bundle, two of which directly address PF3: field 2 — `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__read_page` with `filter: "interactive"` so every `<a>` is in the agent brief — and field 3 — a `javascript_tool` dump of `Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('a')).map(a => ({text, href}))` as belt-and-braces. The skill's opening note on step 3 explicitly cites PF3: "every field below is **required** in the brief handed to all four agents. Missing fields cause systematic false positives (e.g., missing-anchor findings when `get_page_text` strips link info — see PF3)." The systematic false-positive class that produced R01 + R11 in the original audit is structurally prevented going forward.

## OMC deep-review backlog (added 2026-05-18)

Source: 4-lane parallel OMC review (architect / pouk-ai-content / code-reviewer / critic) of the worktree `funny-chebyshev-beebd7` on 2026-05-18 evening. P0 slice (8 items) shipped in the same session — see commit thread. Items below are P1/P2/P3 + 5 PM/founder follow-ups surfaced by P0 execution itself. Severity scale matches the review:

- **P1** — declared standard not enforced, voice/audience drift across pages, page does the same thing two different ways. Worth fixing before the next deploy.
- **P2** — drift / dead code / undocumented config. Worth a sweep.
- **P3** — cosmetic.

### Follow-ups from the P0 ship (need founder call)

- [ ] **OMC-F1 — `/404` eyebrow `404` dropped during P0 build** ~~(Owner: pm + content + DS · Effort: M)~~ — **Founder decision 2026-05-18 evening: file DS proposal for eyebrow + h1 combo (Option B from the surface set).** DS proposal filed at [`meta/proposals/ds-side/hero-eyebrow-with-title.md`](proposals/ds-side/hero-eyebrow-with-title.md) — proposes Option A (eyebrow as new optional slot in default variant; backwards-compatible). Status: not yet filed in `poukai-inc/poukai-ui` issue tracker; file at proposal ratification. Adoption sequence in §8 of the proposal. Until DS ships the surface, `/404` ships without the eyebrow (P0 state). Once DS lands, `NotFoundHero.tsx` regains the `eyebrow="404"` prop and OMC-F1 closes alongside the version bump.

- [x] **OMC-F2 — `/about` portrait alt still says "saturated orange backdrop"** ~~(Owner: pm + founder · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-18 evening.** Founder confirmed: the photo asset (`public/about-portrait.jpg`) retains the saturated orange backdrop in-frame; only the page-level CSS band was retired in v2.1. Alt text in `src/content/about.json:14` stays accurate as written. No edit needed. Code comments in `AboutBand.tsx` already cleaned up during P0 ship.

- [x] **OMC-F3 — Home meta description carries "Founded by a frontend engineer"** ~~(Owner: pm + founder · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-18 evening.** Founder approved "drop the phrase". Rewrote `src/pages/index.astro:28` meta description from 145 chars to 113 chars: `Custom AI builds, automations, and advisory for teams that need to ship. Currently taking conversations for Q3.` Source draft amended at `meta/content/drafts/pages/home.md` §2 pageDescription block + §3 SEO copy block with v2.1 amendment audit log. The credential register now lives in operator-grade discipline tags ("custom AI builds, automations, and advisory") rather than founder-arc biography — matches /about v2.1's supportingLine.

- [x] **OMC-F4 — `/about` spec says `jobTitle: "Founder, pouk.ai"`, code ships `"Founder"`** ~~(Owner: pm · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-18 evening.** Founder approved "code wins; amend spec". `meta/specs/pages/about.md:130` revised to `jobTitle: "Founder"` with v2.1 amendment audit log inline. Rationale: the `url` field already carries the brand surface (`pouk.ai/about`), so suffixing the title with `, pouk.ai` was redundant + read as marketing rather than schema. Cleaner schema; same Knowledge Graph entity.

- [x] **OMC-F5 — `/about` spec says portrait `aspect="3:4"`, asset is 1:1** ~~(Owner: pm · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-18 evening.** Founder approved "amend spec to 1:1". `meta/specs/pages/about.md` §6.1 lines 110-111 revised: aspect ratio `3:4 → 1:1`, source resolution `≥1600px → 1024px` (matching the shipped 1024×1024 JPEG). Both clauses carry v2.1 amendment audit log. Asset-authority lock made explicit — future reshoots that revert to 3:4 will flip the spec clause + `src/content/about.json` `band.portrait.aspect` + `src/content/_schemas/about.ts` enum + `AboutBand.tsx` consumption atomically.

### P1 — voice / copy drift (founder voice calls)

- [x] **OMC-V1 — Audience-flip on `/why-ai`: addresses consultant-reader, not prospect** ~~(Owner: pm + content · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Founder ratified "Prospect sitewide" on 2026-05-18 evening. `pouk-ai-content` agent drafted prospect-aimed rewrite for `src/pages/why-ai.astro:102` + `:165-191` block. Founder approved drafted version 2026-05-19. Shipped: line 102 ("This is the gap pouk.ai works in.") + h2 ("Where pouk.ai works — business knowledge meets AI tooling") + new prospect-aimed paragraphs + retired dialogue couplet. **PM follow-up open**: `meta/specs/pages/why-ai.md` §5 amendments per agent deliverable §5 (see backlog item OMC-V-spec-followups below).

- [x] **OMC-V2 — Audience-flip on `/principles` bodies + hero "we"** ~~(Owner: pm + content · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Founder ratified "Prospect sitewide" on 2026-05-18 evening. Shipped: hero lede `:50` (`we work from` → `pouk.ai works from`), `principles.json` intro (56w, names operating discipline + three cash-out moments), conclusion (43w, bridges to end CTA), and all 10 principle bodies (rewritten as declaratives about how pouk.ai operates; aphorisms + consultant-pep-talk retired). Principle ix Willingness to fail flagged at 88w as the principle most at risk of resisting the flip — founder approved current rewrite; re-spec option as `Iteration discipline` documented but not exercised. **PM follow-up open**: `meta/specs/pages/principles.md` §5 amendments per agent deliverable §5 (see backlog item OMC-V-spec-followups below).

- [x] **OMC-V3 — `/roles` end-CTA uses "we'll work it out together"** ~~(Owner: pm + content · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Shipped: `src/pages/roles.astro:70` rewritten to drop `and we'll work it out together`. Final copy: "Not sure which fits? Describe your situation. hello@pouk.ai →". Closes the fake-plurality break against the v2.1 contract.

- [x] **OMC-V4 — `/why-ai` dialogue line uses "our AI product" + "You answer"** ~~(Owner: pm + content · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Lines stripped entirely as part of the OMC-V1 block replacement on `src/pages/why-ai.astro:165-191`. The discovery questions block already carried the diagnostic claim; the dialogue couplet was redundant. Replaced with the section's closer: "The diagnosis comes before the build. That is the order pouk.ai works in."

- [x] **OMC-V5 — Page-title separator split 3:3 across surfaces** ~~(Owner: content · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Shipped: `roles.astro:26` → `"Roles — pouk.ai"`; `principles.astro:25` → `"Principles — pouk.ai"`; `why-ai.astro:30` → `"Why AI projects fail — pouk.ai"`. All three flipped from pipe-separator to em-dash, matching `/about`, `/`, `/404` convention. Long descriptors retired from page titles (JSON-LD `name` field already carries them where needed).

- [x] **OMC-V6 — Concept-noun drift: "agents" / "AI systems" / "AI work" used interchangeably** ~~(Owner: pm + content · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Founder ratified `"AI systems"` as canonical concept noun. Shipped sweep: `about.json:4` + `:7` ("AI work in production" → "AI systems in production"); `roles.json:6` (Builder body, dropped `, agents` from dashboards/internal-tools/client-facing-products list); `roles.json:30` (Creator body, dropped ` with agents` from full-service-agencies sentence); `principles.json` body iv Systems thinking adopted "AI systems that keep paying off". Citation-keep: `failure-modes.json:15,19` retain "sector-specific AI agents" verbatim from the research source; `why-ai.astro:145` retains "Domain-specific agents" verbatim from the parallel research finding; `why-ai.astro:221` retains "AI Agent ROI in 2026" verbatim as the source article title.

- [x] **OMC-V7 — `/why-ai` load-bearing claim phrased 4 ways** ~~(Owner: pm + content · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Founder ratified `"Why AI projects fail — and what to do about it"` (current H1 phrasing) as canonical. Shipped sweep: `why-ai.astro:30` page title → `"Why AI projects fail — pouk.ai"` (short form, matches em-dash convention per OMC-V5); `:38` JSON-LD headline → `"Why AI projects fail — and what to do about it"` (matches H1); `/404` link list descriptor at `src/pages/404.astro` → `"Why AI projects fail"` (4w, matches H1 first half). Meta description (`:31`) left unchanged — its lede stats are still on-topic.

- [x] **OMC-V8 — Deliverable triple phrased 3 ways** ~~(Owner: pm + content · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Founder ratified `"Custom AI builds. Automations. Advisory engagements."` (period-separated form, matching `/about` band supportingLine) as canonical sitewide. Shipped: `src/pages/index.astro:28` home meta → `"Custom AI builds. Automations. Advisory engagements. Currently taking conversations for Q3."` (94 chars); `src/content/about.json:4` + `:7` about meta → `"pouk.ai is a technical consultancy that ships AI systems in production. Custom AI builds. Automations. Advisory engagements. hello@pouk.ai."` (139 chars). Both incorporate the V6 sweep ("AI work" → "AI systems") atomically.

- [ ] **OMC-V-spec-followups — PM amendments to `/why-ai` + `/principles` specs** ~~(Owner: pm · Effort: M)~~ — Content rewrites for OMC-V1/V2 landed in code 2026-05-19; PM follow-up enumerated in the `pouk-ai-content` agent deliverable §5 has not yet been applied. To do:
  - `meta/specs/pages/why-ai.md` — amend §5 outcomes for "the consulting angle" section and discovery questions to reflect prospect audience; add §5 banned-register note on dialogue-format couplets; add §8 AC on prospect-audience contract.
  - `meta/specs/pages/principles.md` — amend §5 voice outcomes on intro/conclusion + ten principles to drop "founder's personal compass" license-for-introspection language and lock prospect-audience declarative voice; add §5 anti-aphorism banned-register line ("Consistency is credibility", etc.); update §5 hero lede footer to the shipped string; add §8 AC on prospect-audience contract; document the option to re-spec principle ix as `Iteration discipline` if the rewrite reads consultant-aimed in future revision.
  - `meta/content/drafts/pages/principles.md` — does not yet exist as a versioned draft; if PM creates one to anchor the v2.1 prospect-audience copy, the new intro/conclusion/10-bodies copy is the source of truth (taken from the agent deliverable + shipped via `principles.json`).

### P1 — R-076 / code-DS / standards-vs-reality

- [x] **OMC-C1 — R-076 violated on `/`: home copy hardcoded in template** ~~(Owner: engineer + pm · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Founder ratified "Extract both to JSON + Zod schemas". Shipped: `src/content/home.json` + `src/content/_schemas/home.ts` (Zod schema with split title fragments to preserve `<em>AI</em>` rendering); `src/pages/index.astro` wired to source from JSON; `src/components/HomeHero.tsx` rewritten to accept 10 scalar props. `src/components/HomeHero.test.tsx` updated with `mockProps` fixture mirroring home.json verbatim — 5 vitest assertions still pass. Build green; lint green; D-11 + D-12 locks preserved at the JSON layer.

- [x] **OMC-C2 — R-076 violated on `/why-ai`: ~800 words hardcoded in template** ~~(Owner: engineer + pm · Effort: L)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Founder ratified "Extract both to JSON + Zod schemas". Shipped: `src/content/why-ai.json` (~150-line content file with meta, hero, openingArgument {intro + 4 stat highlights + 4 connectors + statsRow}, pivot, failureModesIntro, leaders {heading + intro + 4 items + outro + 3 quartile stats}, whereWorks {heading + body + 4 discovery questions + closing}, endCta {primary + secondary}, 4 references, lastReviewed, jsonLd) + `src/content/_schemas/why-ai.ts` (full Zod schema with `.length(4)` / `.length(3)` exact-count assertions). `src/pages/why-ai.astro` rewritten to source all copy from JSON; failure-mode cards continue to source from `failure-modes.json` via the existing content collection. Build green; HTML weight gate (R-015) shows /why-ai at +0.1% vs baseline.

- [x] **OMC-C3 — `<Hero entrance="stagger">` inconsistent across pages** ~~(Owner: designer + engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Founder ratified "Document per-page rationale, keep current state". Shipped: `meta/decisions/2026-05-19-hero-stagger-scope.md` (Locked decision doc): editorial doorways (`/`, `/about`) ship stagger; functional content pages (`/why-ai`, `/roles`, `/principles`, `/404`) ship static first-paint. Doc captures per-page status table + future-pages contract + reclassification protocol.

- [x] **OMC-C4 — `about.astro` docblock retired during P0 ship — confirm clean** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19 (verified).** Inline confirmation during the C5/C6 mechanical wave: `src/pages/about.astro` docblock references v2.1 supersedes v1, no v2.0 operator-line residue. `src/components/AboutBand.tsx` docblock references "DS 0.13.0+" (bleed) + "DS 0.15.0" (Portrait); accurate. No further edits required.

- [x] **OMC-C5 — Compositions stale on DS version** ~~(Owner: designer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Shipped: `meta/compositions/pages/home.md:8` field split into "DS version targeted (original)" + "DS version shipped (current, 2026-05-19) — `@poukai-inc/ui@0.15.0`" with a one-line note that the three §6 proposals shipped (Hero size 0.7.0, entrance 0.8.0, Button compact 0.9.0; illustration deferred via deferral note). `meta/compositions/pages/about.md:10` same pattern — bumped from 0.14.0 to 0.15.0 with note that the 0.15.0 bump shipped the `<Portrait>` molecule.

- [x] **OMC-C6 — `site.css` magic numbers outside DS tokens** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Shipped: `--site-toc-width: 14rem` extracted to a `:root` custom-property block at the top of site.css (single-consumer documented); `.principles-bookend` `max-width: 38rem` swapped to `var(--hero-max)` (the DS token at the same value, used for column-axis parity with Hero text); `.principles-bookend` clamp() type-ramp annotated inline as a site-side exception with clear escalation path (file a DS proposal for `--fs-editorial-mid` if a second editorial bookend surface needs the same scale).

- [x] **OMC-C7 — Empty `.about-band` CSS rule block** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Shipped: empty rule block in `src/styles/site.css:296-301` deleted; explanatory comment promoted to standalone code comment documenting why the `.about-band` wrapper class is preserved as a scope anchor for the descendant `.about-band h1` clamp + `.about-band__caption` styling.

### P1 — CI / standards enforcement gaps

- [x] **OMC-CI1 — ESLint declared per-PR gate (R-073) but not installed** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Founder ratified "Install + minimal config + CI step". Shipped via [poukai-inc/pouk.ai PR #33](https://github.com/poukai-inc/pouk.ai/pull/33): `eslint.config.js` flat config (no-console error, no-debugger error, @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars warn, @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any warn); `pnpm lint` script wired (`eslint src --max-warnings=0`); CI `lint` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` positioned before `audit`. 5 new devDeps (all MIT). `pnpm lint` exits 0 against current codebase.

- [x] **OMC-CI2 — R-010 client-JS budget (75 kB) not CI-enforced** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: M)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Founder ratified "Implement all three CI steps". Shipped via PR #33: `.github/scripts/client-js-budget.mjs` walks `dist/**/*.html`, parses external `<script src>` tags, skips `_astro/` islands per R-009(c), counts Vercel Analytics statically at ~1.5 kB when present, gzips + sums the rest, fails if any page exceeds 75 kB. CI `client-js-budget` job added. Default build (no Matomo/Bugsink env vars) registers 0.0 kB across all 6 routes.

- [x] **OMC-CI3 — R-015 HTML weight parity not CI-enforced** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19.** Shipped via PR #33: `.github/baselines/html-weight.json` committed at current state (/ 4846B, /why-ai 8461B, /roles 6320B, /principles 7160B, /about 5672B, /404 4671B — all gzipped); `.github/scripts/html-weight-check.mjs` compares per-route current vs baseline, fails if any route > 110%, emits markdown table for PR-review visibility; CI `html-weight` job added. Baseline update protocol (manual, never auto-updated) documented in script header.

- [x] **OMC-CI4 — R-042-R-045 security-header verification not CI-enforced** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — **Closed 2026-05-19 (config-side).** Shipped via PR #33: `.github/scripts/security-headers-check.mjs` reads `vercel.json` + asserts the four required header keys (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) present in the catch-all rule; `X-Frame-Options: DENY` checked warn-only (pending future R-082 standards amendment). CI `security-headers` job added (no build dep). **Note**: this is a config-correctness check; runtime verification (curl -I against Vercel preview URL) remains a deploy-time check — documented in standards split as "config (CI)" + "runtime (curl -I at deploy time)". Full runtime automation requires a `deployment_status` webhook job, tracked separately.

### P2 — drift / dead code / undocumented

- [ ] **OMC-P2.1 — Principle titles use Title Case; sitewide convention is sentence-case** ~~(Owner: content · Effort: S)~~ — `src/content/principles.json` titles: "Systems Thinking", "Intellectual Curiosity", "Willingness to Fail", "Good Nature". Agent §4.3 mandates sentence-case headings; rest of site sentence-cases. Verify with DS whether `Principle` molecule has any title-case opinion; if not, lowercase to "Systems thinking", "Intellectual curiosity", "Willingness to fail", "Good nature".

- [ ] **OMC-P2.2 — Maxim closers in principle bodies vs v2.1 no-maxims rule** ~~(Owner: content · Effort: S)~~ — `principles.json:21,39,51` end on aphoristic one-liners ("Consistency is credibility.", "Obsession is what turns skill into mastery.", "Momentum beats perfection every time."). Same "X is Y" shape the /404 draft explicitly rejected ("Pages come and go"). Either accept maxims as `/principles` register and document the exception, or revise the three closers to declarative non-aphoristic shapes.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.3 — Cross-link in `/why-ai` end-CTA without sitewide parity** ~~(Owner: content · Effort: S)~~ — `why-ai.astro:201` adds "Or read about the four shapes of help pouk.ai delivers: Roles →" to the end-CTA block. No other page cross-links from its end-CTA. Either add equivalent cross-links to other pages' end-CTAs (sitewide pattern), or strike this one line (mailto-only end-CTA, matching the other pages).

- [ ] **OMC-P2.4 — Dead CSS class `.about-story__operator`** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `src/styles/site.css:372-377` defines the operator-line block; the block was retired in v2.1 per about.astro comments. Remove the unused rule.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.5 — `BaseLayout.astro` TODOs without tracking issues** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro:90,95` reference open questions O-011 (Matomo endpoint) and O-012 (Bugsink DSN). R-073 (HARD) says "no TODO without a tracking issue". Either create GH issues for O-011 + O-012 and link as `TODO(#NN)`, or remove the TODO prefix and document that the open-question references in the standards doc are the tracking mechanism.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.6 — Matomo/Bugsink template-literal env interpolation is fragile** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `BaseLayout.astro:101-119` builds Matomo + Bugsink script strings via `${matomoUrl}` and `${bugsinkDsn}` interpolated into a template literal that becomes `set:html`. If a `PUBLIC_*` env var contained a closing `</script>` tag or JS payload, it would execute. Build-time env vars are repo-owner-controlled so the risk is low — but the pattern is fragile. Add a regex-validation on URL/DSN format before interpolation, or use a stricter construction.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.7 — `aria-labelledby="fm-title-${index}"` may point to nothing** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `src/pages/why-ai.astro:115` constructs the aria target id in the page template, but the DS `FailureMode` component renders its own heading and may not emit an element with that id. If it doesn't, the aria-labelledby points to nothing — WCAG 4.1.2 violation. Verify the DS component's output via `read_page` / `getComputedStyle`; either remove the aria-labelledby or coordinate with DS to expose the id.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.8 — `stats-row` hand-rolled with `role="list"` + `role="listitem"` divs 3x in `/why-ai`** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `why-ai.astro:87-99,121-132,152-162` repeat the same markup three times. Extract a `StatsRow` helper or use native `<ul>`/`<li>` semantics (R-032 — ARIA only when semantic HTML cannot carry the meaning). Native semantics + DS `<Stat>` molecule already does the row item.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.9 — Jump-nav / TOC pattern implemented two ways** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `/roles` uses flat `<nav>` with flex-wrap anchors; `/why-ai` uses `<nav>` with `<ol>`. Both serve the same purpose. Align on one pattern (recommend the `<ol>` shape since it preserves enumeration semantics).

- [ ] **OMC-P2.10 — Stale `BaseLayout.astro` comment about `public/index.html`** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `BaseLayout.astro:12` comment says "Does NOT port the static /index.html — that lives verbatim in public/". The static `public/index.html` was deleted; the comment is now misleading. Remove or update.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.11 — Three component docblocks repeat the same JSX-boundary explanation** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `HomeHero.tsx:1-17`, `AboutBand.tsx:1-32`, `ShellWrapper.tsx:1-14` (and now `NotFoundHero.tsx`) all explain the esbuild .astro→React JSX boundary rationale in nearly identical wording. Extract to a single `meta/architecture.md` section (or repo-root `ARCHITECTURE.md`) and reference from each component with a one-liner.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.12 — `failure-modes.json` schema: `source` optional but always provided** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `src/content.config.ts:9` declares `statSchema.source: z.string().optional()`. All stats in `failure-modes.json` carry `source`. If it's always required in practice, tighten to non-optional to catch data-entry errors at build time.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.13 — `vitest.config.ts` coverage include list outdated** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — Only tracks `HomeHero.tsx`. Comments say "Add as smoke tests land" for `RolesGrid` and `ShellWrapper`. `AboutBand.tsx` (and now `NotFoundHero.tsx`) not mentioned. If anyone adds tests for those components, coverage won't gate. Add the missing component paths to the commented-out include list so they are on the radar.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.14 — `astro check` embedded in `pnpm build` vs declared as separate gate** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `package.json:10` runs `astro check && astro build` in the `build` script. R-055 verification matrix implies a separate `typecheck` step. Failures surface as build failures, not type-check failures. Either add a separate `typecheck` script + CI step, or update the verification matrix to document type-checking is embedded in the build.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.15 — `robots.txt` references `sitemap-index.xml`; verify filename emitted matches post-deploy** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `public/robots.txt:4` points at `sitemap-index.xml`. P0 ship verified locally that `@astrojs/sitemap@3.3.0` emits `sitemap-index.xml` + `sitemap-0.xml` (with /404 excluded). Spot-check post-deploy that production serves them at the same path; if any future DS or astro bump renames the file, update `robots.txt` atomically.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.16 — `security.txt` references `security@pouk.ai` which may not be a live mailbox** ~~(Owner: founder + ops · Effort: S)~~ — `public/.well-known/security.txt` Contact line points to `security@pouk.ai`. R-081 said SOFT until `hello@pouk.ai` was live; that's now true, but `security@` is a different mailbox. A vulnerability reporter emailing `security@pouk.ai` may get a bounce. Either provision the mailbox (Google Workspace alias is sufficient), or change Contact to `hello@pouk.ai`.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.17 — `X-Frame-Options: DENY` in `vercel.json` undocumented in standards** ~~(Owner: pm · Effort: S)~~ — `vercel.json:14` ships `X-Frame-Options: DENY`. R-042-R-045 in the standards doc list HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy — not X-Frame-Options. Standards doc is incomplete, not the config. Add `X-Frame-Options` as R-082 in the standards doc to make the security-header set explicit (P0 ship added Vercel Analytics as the most recent R-009/R-010 amendment; XFO can land in the same section).

- [ ] **OMC-P2.18 — `@astrojs/check` caret range `^0.9.4`** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `package.json:35`. R-065 permits caret on dev deps; `@astrojs/check` is build-blocking via the embedded `astro check` step. A bad minor bump could break CI nondeterministically. Pin to an exact version, or accept the caret since the lockfile pins the resolved version.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.19 — D-13 references three-item nav; site ships four** ~~(Owner: pm · Effort: S)~~ — Specs that reference D-13 in passing assume the three-item nav from before `/about` shipped. Sweep specs that reference "four routes" / "three routes in nav" and align with current four-item nav (A4 supersedes D-13's framing for the about-shipping window). P0 already updated R-007 to "five canonical routes"; this is the spec-side sweep.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.20 — Renovate / Dependabot config absent (R-068 SOFT)** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — No `.github/renovate.json`, no `.github/dependabot.yml`. Dependency updates are entirely manual. Add a minimal Dependabot config (weekly, grouped) or a Renovate baseline, or acknowledge the gap formally in R-068.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.21 — Sentence-case audit on principle anchor IDs vs title casing** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — Bundled with OMC-P2.1; principle anchor IDs (`#systems-thinking`, `#intellectual-curiosity`) are already lowercase-kebab — they're correct. Verify post-rewrite that lowercase titles still match the anchor mapping the spec locks.

- [ ] **OMC-P2.22 — Visual-regression suite coverage for `/404`** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `tests/visual.spec.ts` and `tests/tab-order.spec.ts` were extended with `/about` in commit `ac27bd8`. The P0 ship added `/404.astro`. Argos baseline does not yet include it. Add `/404` to the visual + tab-order suites so the salvage page doesn't drift unnoticed.

### P3 — cosmetic

- [ ] **OMC-P3.1 — `.footnote-ref { font-size: 0.7em }` magic** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `src/styles/site.css:159`. Extract to a custom property or document why 0.7em is the chosen size.

- [ ] **OMC-P3.2 — JSON-LD `@type` varies: `WebPage` on roles/principles, `Article` on why-ai** ~~(Owner: pm · Effort: S)~~ — `roles.astro:34`, `principles.astro:33`, `why-ai.astro:36`. The Article type on `/why-ai` is defensible (it has an author and dateModified), but the divergence should be a conscious decision. Verify Article is the correct schema.org type for a thesis page vs. a standard web page.

- [ ] **OMC-P3.3 — End-CTA arrow inconsistent — only `/roles` ships `→`** ~~(Owner: content · Effort: S)~~ — `roles.astro:71` ends with "hello@pouk.ai →"; `about.astro:180-182`, `principles.astro:79-81`, `why-ai.astro:194-196` ship "hello@pouk.ai" without the arrow. Pick one and propagate.

- [ ] **OMC-P3.4 — `HomeHero.test.tsx` indentation: tabs vs spaces** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — Minor formatting inconsistency in the test file. Run a formatter for consistency (once OMC-CI1 lands ESLint / Prettier).

- [ ] **OMC-P3.5 — `RolesGrid.tsx` `aria-hidden={true as const}` redundant** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `src/components/RolesGrid.tsx:32`. TypeScript already infers the boolean literal `true`. Remove the `as const`.

- [ ] **OMC-P3.6 — `BaseLayout.astro` `as string | undefined` cast on `import.meta.env` redundant** ~~(Owner: engineer · Effort: S)~~ — `BaseLayout.astro:91-92`. Astro's env types via `astro/client.d.ts` already type `PUBLIC_*` vars as `string | undefined`. Remove the manual cast, or add a note explaining why it's needed.

- [ ] **OMC-P3.7 — `/why-ai` reference link text accuracy** ~~(Owner: content · Effort: S)~~ — `why-ai.astro:209` reference link text claims "5%" but the page body says 12-18% (the page's own thesis stat). Verify the reference title matches the linked article's actual title; correct if mismatched.

## New page proposals (added 2026-05-19)

- [ ] **NPP-1 — `/onboarding` page: pouk.ai onboarding playbook** ~~(Owner: pm → content → designer → engineer · Effort: L)~~ — Net-new canonical route. Goal: adapt an external 4-phase consulting-engagement framework into a playbook that reads as **how seamless the onboarding of pouk.ai's AI experts into a client's process is**. Tone: engaging. Not a verbatim port — the source is a generic-AI-consultant framework; the page reframes the same structure as pouk.ai's actual operating model, so the prospect reads how the engagement runs once they say yes.

  **Source content (verbatim, for the content drafter):**

  > **How to Structure an AI Consulting Engagement — From Discovery to Delivery (12 min read)**
  >
  > The most common failure mode for first-time AI consultants isn't technical — it's structural. They take a brief, build something, deliver it, and hit one of three outcomes: the client doesn't use it, the client asks for endless changes that weren't scoped, or the engagement ends with no clear measure of success. If May 7's digest covered why AI projects fail, this one covers how to structure an engagement so yours doesn't.
  >
  > **The four-phase framework**
  >
  > **Phase 1 — Discovery (1–2 weeks)**
  >
  > Discovery is where you decide whether to take the engagement, understand the actual problem, and define what success looks like. This phase should be paid — not free. Charging for discovery (at a reduced rate if needed) accomplishes two things: it filters out clients who aren't serious, and it sets the precedent that your time has value from day one.
  >
  > The key questions to answer during discovery:
  >
  > - **What is the specific target workflow?** Push until you have a concrete description. Not "we want AI to help with customer service" but "we have 4 agents handling 180 inbound queries per day; roughly 65% are routine FAQ questions taking 5–7 minutes each; we want to reduce that volume handled by humans." The difference is the difference between a vague pilot and a scoped project.
  > - **What does the data look like?** Where does it live? Who controls access? Is it structured, clean, consistently formatted? This is your single biggest technical risk. Data problems kill more AI projects than model limitations — and you can't know what you're walking into until you've seen the data.
  > - **Who owns this after you leave?** One person, by name. If the answer is "the team" or "IT," escalate. AI tools without a clear owner drift, break, and get abandoned. Identifying and aligning an executive sponsor is part of discovery.
  > - **What does success look like in 90 days?** Define a specific, measurable outcome before the build, not after. "People are using it" is not a metric. "65% of FAQ queries auto-resolved without human intervention, as measured in the ticketing system" is a metric. You'll need this baseline to demonstrate ROI — and to protect yourself if the client later claims it "doesn't work."
  >
  > Deliverable: a Discovery Brief — a 2–4 page document summarizing the problem, your recommendation, what you are not recommending and why, and an initial scope and budget estimate. This document does double duty: it aligns expectations and becomes the basis for the Statement of Work.
  >
  > **Phase 2 — Scoping (1 week)**
  >
  > Turn the Discovery Brief into a Statement of Work (SOW). The SOW is the legal and practical backbone of the engagement. Every ambiguity in it becomes a scope dispute later.
  >
  > What the SOW must define:
  >
  > - **Deliverables** — specific enough that both parties agree. Not "an AI assistant" but "a Slack-integrated assistant that answers questions from a provided FAQ document set, flags low-confidence queries for human review, and logs all interactions to a shared spreadsheet for monitoring."
  > - **Out of scope** — written explicitly. This clause protects you more than any other part of the document. If it's not in scope, it costs extra.
  > - **Milestones and timeline** — at minimum: working prototype (end of week N), testing and iteration (weeks N+1 to N+2), final delivery (end of week N+3). Milestones give you payment triggers and give the client visibility.
  > - **Payment terms** — 50% upfront, 50% at final delivery for projects under $25K. Larger engagements split into milestone-based payments (e.g., 33% upfront, 33% at prototype approval, 33% at delivery). Never start work without money in hand.
  > - **Data access timeline** — getting data from clients is almost always the rate-limiting step, and it almost always takes longer than anyone expects. Build this into the schedule explicitly; if data is late, your timeline adjusts.
  >
  > **Phase 3 — Build (2–6 weeks)**
  >
  > Deliver in layers, not in a single big reveal. The typical sequence for an AI project:
  >
  > 1. **Working prototype on sample/synthetic data (week 1–2):** Proves the architecture works before you've integrated anything real. Shows the client something tangible early.
  > 2. **Integration with real client data (week 2–3):** This is where unexpected problems surface — data quality issues, access constraints, edge cases in the actual documents or queries. You want time to address them.
  > 3. **Testing and iteration (week 3–5):** Client tests the tool against real workflows. You address failure modes, evaluate output quality, refine prompts.
  > 4. **Final delivery (last week):** Documentation, handoff, owner training.
  >
  > Two principles that save projects:
  >
  > **Show something working as early as possible.** Even a rough prototype with sample data changes the client relationship. Clients who can see something responding to their actual use case are more engaged and give much better feedback than clients asked to approve a spec document.
  >
  > **Track quality metrics from day one.** For an AI tool, you should be measuring: task completion rate, hallucination rate on test cases, latency, and — once deployed — user adoption. These numbers are your evidence of success. Build them into the project from the start.
  >
  > **Phase 4 — Handoff**
  >
  > A well-delivered AI project ends with:
  >
  > - Written documentation covering what the system does, what it doesn't do, how to update or add knowledge (for RAG systems), and who to contact for API/infrastructure issues.
  > - A live walkthrough with the designated owner — not a screen recording, but an interactive session where they can ask questions.
  > - A 30-day check-in built into the engagement. Not optional, not a favor — a scheduled call at day 30 to address questions, check adoption metrics, and assess whether Phase 2 makes sense.
  >
  > The 30-day check-in is also where the next engagement begins. If the tool is working, there's almost always a natural extension: a second department, a more complex workflow, a performance improvement. Your best source of new business is a client who just had a successful first project.
  >
  > **Pricing in 2026**
  >
  > Two practical models:
  >
  > **Fixed-scope, fixed-price:** You scope it tightly, set a price, deliver it. Predictable for both parties. Works best for well-defined problems. Protect yourself with a tight "out of scope" clause and a change-order process for anything added after the SOW is signed.
  >
  > **Time-and-materials:** You charge a day rate and track hours, often with a budget ceiling. Works best when the data situation is unknown or the problem is exploratory. Clients who want cost predictability usually push for fixed-price; meet them there if you can.
  >
  > Day rates for AI consultants currently range from $800–$2,500/day depending on specialization, track record, and geography. Until you have case studies, price at the lower-mid range and build your portfolio. After two or three delivered projects with documented ROI, your rates should move up meaningfully.
  >
  > **The first client**
  >
  > Your first engagement will almost certainly come from your existing network — a former employer, a contact who knows your background. Charge a discounted rate (not free) in exchange for a reference call and a written case study. That case study — one page describing the problem, what you built, and the measurable outcome — is your primary marketing asset for the next 12–18 months.

  **Brief direction (founder, 2026-05-19):**

  - **Audience flip is the load-bearing move.** Source addresses a fellow consultant ("you, the consultant, structuring your engagement"). Page rewrites to address a prospect ("here's how an engagement with pouk.ai runs once you say yes") — same prospect-audience contract that closed OMC-V1/V2 on /why-ai + /principles. The four-phase framework becomes pouk.ai's operating model, not generic consultant advice.
  - **Reframe each phase from pouk.ai's standpoint.** Discovery = "the first two weeks pouk.ai spends with your team"; Scoping = "the SOW pouk.ai writes from the Discovery Brief"; Build = "what shipping looks like inside your stack"; Handoff = "what your in-house team owns when pouk.ai's engagement ends". Same structural bones — different voice anchor.
  - **Pricing section: ratify or retire.** Source carries specific $800–$2,500/day rates + 50/50 payment terms. Founder decides whether pouk.ai publishes rates + payment terms publicly, or compresses to "transparent SOW, milestone-based payments" without numerals. Both defensible; PM picks.
  - **The "first client" section retires.** It's consultant-self-talk (network-leverage advice for the consultant). Doesn't translate to a prospect-facing page. Skip entirely.
  - **Tone: engaging.** Stays within the brand-voice contract (no marketing-speak, no "we", no aphorisms), but the prose moves faster than `/about` v2.1's editorial register — closer to `/roles`'s diagnostic-and-invitational tempo. The page is the prospect's read after they've decided to take pouk.ai seriously and want to know how the next 4–6 weeks actually look.

  **PM lane (open work):**

  - [ ] **Spec** — author `meta/specs/pages/onboarding.md` (Approved status before content draft begins). Decide: in nav or standalone-deep-link? Place in the funnel — pre-CTA or post-CTA? Five canonical routes become six? (R-007 needs amendment if so.) JSON-LD type? Sitemap inclusion? Mobile read-time target? Decision on whether pricing section ships verbatim numerals or compressed register.
  - [ ] **Content draft** — once spec lands, `pouk-ai-content` agent authors `meta/content/drafts/pages/onboarding.md` against the source above + the founder brief direction. Drafter applies the brand voice contract from `/about` v2.1 — refined, direct, no fake-plurality, no "you, the consultant" register. Drafter surfaces three-point options for high-stakes lines (page H1, lede, end CTA) per agent §6.
  - [ ] **Composition** — `pouk-ai-designer` translates the spec into a DS-primitive recipe in `meta/compositions/pages/onboarding.md`. Likely shape: `<Hero size="intimate"> → 4 numbered phase sections (mirror /why-ai's `<FailureMode>` molecule register? or a new DS molecule?) → pricing section → end CTA`. Designer files DS proposals if the 4-phase pattern needs a new molecule.
  - [ ] **Build** — `pouk-ai-engineer` ships `src/pages/onboarding.astro` + `src/content/onboarding.json` + `src/content/_schemas/onboarding.ts` (R-074, R-076). Adds to nav routes in `BaseLayout.astro` + `ShellWrapper.tsx` if nav-bound. Adds to CI Lighthouse + axe target lists. Adds to /404 link list if PM decides to include it. Adds to Argos visual + tab-order tests. R-007 amendment if route count goes from 5→6.
  - [ ] **Brief drafting on the playbook claim** — the goal phrase "how seamless the onboarding of pouk.ai's AI experts is" needs the founder's read. Does pouk.ai claim "seamless" outright, or does it demonstrate seamlessness through specificity (4 phases, named owners, day-30 check-in)? The brand voice contract probably forbids the literal word "seamless" — too marketing-flavored. Show, don't claim.

  **Out of scope for this backlog item:**

  - Designing or writing the page now — that is the content + designer + engineer lanes once spec lands.
  - Publishing the source article verbatim — the source is consultant-aimed; the page is prospect-aimed. Verbatim port would break the OMC-V1/V2 prospect-audience contract.
  - Linking to the resend-tracked URLs — strip click-trackers to canonical URLs (already done above).
  - Founder rate publication decision — that is a PM call inside the spec, not a backlog framing.

  **Ship sequencing recommendation:** ship after OMC-V1/V2 prospect-audience rewrites land on `/why-ai` + `/principles` (the audience contract is currently mid-flight). `/onboarding` is the third page in the prospect-audience cohort and benefits from landing after the voice contract proves out on the existing pages.

## IA restructure — 2026-05-20 planning record

**Status:** Analysis complete. No tasks opened. Blocked on DS component readiness — `@poukai-inc/ui` maintainers are building new components for this expansion.

**Current IA (5 pages):**

```
/               home
/why-ai         diagnosis
/roles          engagement shapes (4 cards)
/principles     operating values
/about          founder + name origin
```

**Proposed IA (8 pages):**

```
/               home (keep)
/why-ai         diagnosis (keep — minor nav/CTA update)
/solutions      replaces /roles; Roles reframed as capabilities
/enterprise     new — production-grade AI, 7 pillars
/principles     keep
/work           new — case studies / proof
/careers        new — hiring + Roles reframed for candidates
/about          keep
```

**Primary nav:** `Why AI · Solutions · Principles · Work · About`
**Footer nav:** `Careers` (hiring audience is secondary to buyers)

---

### Key decisions recorded

**`/solutions` replaces `/roles`**
Current `/roles` is a top-level nav item with 4 engagement shapes (Builder, Automator, Educator, Creator). These are service capabilities, not standalone concepts. Moving them under `/solutions` frames them correctly as "what pouk.ai delivers" rather than as a taxonomy page.

**`/careers` is a separate page — not `/roles` renamed**
pouk.ai is always in hiring mode. `/careers` serves candidates. Content: why join, the four functions we hire into (Roles content reframed), open roles or "always taking introductions." Roles content pulls double duty — capability proof for buyers on `/solutions`, talent signal for candidates on `/careers`. Same cards, different frame.

**`/enterprise` is a new standalone page**
Content source: founder brief (2026-05-20) covering 7 production pillars (Security & Privacy, Reliability, Monitoring, Human Oversight, Cost Management, Version Control, Interoperability), launch checklist, start-simple ladder, common pitfalls, pre-launch questions. Too substantial to fold into `/solutions` without diluting both. Buyer-objection page: answers "can your systems hold up in production?"

**`/work` is new but build-blocked**
Needs work to show. Placeholder slot in the IA; don't spec or build until there are 2+ case studies to anchor it.

**`/onboarding` (previous backlog item) stays in the funnel**
Not affected by this restructure. Ships after `/why-ai` + `/principles` audience-contract rewrites land.

---

### Build order (when DS components are ready)

1. `/solutions` — highest buyer impact, replaces a live route
2. `/enterprise` — closes production-grade objection
3. `/careers` — hiring signal, lower urgency
4. `/work` — blocked until case studies exist

Each page needs: PM spec → content draft → DS composition → engineer build → review. No lane has been opened yet.

---

### DS dependency note

`@poukai-inc/ui` maintainers are building new components specifically for this IA expansion. No site-side work begins until DS components are ready and versioned. Coordination point: once DS cuts a version that includes the new molecules/organisms needed for `/solutions` and `/enterprise`, re-open this section and begin PM spec lane.

## Stack alignment — 2026-05-20 (issue [#51](https://github.com/poukai-inc/pouk.ai/issues/51))

Cross-repo stack audit on 2026-05-20 (`autopost`, `pouk.ai`, `@poukai-inc/ui`). Five tasks land here. Decisions captured in `poukai org/STACK_ALIGNMENT_DECISIONS.md` (working copy, not pushed). Companion: DS [poukai-inc/poukai-ui#105](https://github.com/poukai-inc/poukai-ui/issues/105); `autopost/BACKLOG.md` rows #37, #38, #117–#121.

### D6 — Bump `@poukai-inc/ui` (HIGH)

**Step 1 (0.17 → 0.18).** Closed — superseded. Repo is at `@poukai-inc/ui@1.0.0` as of [#48](https://github.com/poukai-inc/pouk.ai/pull/48) (commit `f354f94`). Audit snapshot lagged behind real state by ~10 versions; the auto-bump CI pipeline carried the lib all the way through 0.18 → 0.19 → 0.20 → 0.21 → 0.22 → 0.22.1 → 1.0.0 in the interim.

**Step 2 (next R19-compatible release).** Open — gated. Land simultaneously with D1 React 19 upgrade. Trigger: `@poukai-inc/ui` ships the dual-peer (`react >=18 || >=19`) release tracked in [poukai-inc/poukai-ui#105](https://github.com/poukai-inc/poukai-ui/issues/105). Auto-bump CI may pick it up before D1 lands — if so, hold the bump PR until React 19 is ready (do not merge a lib version that drops React 18 peer support until R19 is in place here).

### D1 — React 18 → 19 upgrade (HIGH, gated)

`pouk.ai` runs React 18.3.1; `autopost` runs React 19 (Next 16 forced). Org converges on R19.

**Gate.** Wait for [poukai-inc/poukai-ui#105](https://github.com/poukai-inc/poukai-ui/issues/105) lib release with dual-peer support.

**Tasks (after gate clears):**

- [ ] Bump `react` 18.3.1 → 19.x, `react-dom` 18.3.1 → 19.x in `package.json`
- [ ] Bump `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to 19.x
- [ ] Bump `@poukai-inc/ui` to the R19-compatible release (D6 step 2)
- [ ] Update `@astrojs/react` if needed for R19 compatibility (currently 4.2.1)
- [ ] Re-run Vitest + Playwright + Argos visual tests; resolve regressions
- [ ] Confirm `eslint.config.js` `settings.react.version` resolves to 19 (currently inherits from `package.json`)

### D4 — `lucide-react` alignment (MEDIUM, cross-repo coordinated)

Three different versions across the org: `autopost` 0.562, `pouk.ai` 0.511, lib peer `>=0.400`. Note: lucide-react has since cut a 1.x line (latest 1.16.0 at audit recheck) — the org-wide decision still stands at "same recent 0.5xx" per [#51](https://github.com/poukai-inc/pouk.ai/issues/51); confirm with `autopost` and `@poukai-inc/ui` whether to revise the target to 1.x before bumping here.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Confirm coordinated target version with `autopost` + `@poukai-inc/ui` (suggest `0.562` to match autopost; revisit if org agrees on 1.x)
- [ ] Bump `lucide-react` 0.511 → target in `package.json`
- [ ] Audit lucide changelog between 0.511 and target for icon renames; verify no breakage in components/pages
- [ ] Land same minor as the other two repos within the same sprint

### C8 — Pin pnpm via `packageManager` (P2, LOW, deferred)

`autopost` pins `pnpm@10.33.0`. This repo declares pnpm via lockfile but no `packageManager` field → CI/dev machines can resolve different minors → lockfile churn. Local pnpm currently resolves to `10.33.0`.

**Task:**

- [ ] Add `"packageManager": "pnpm@10.33.0"` to `package.json`

### C4 — Vite version duplication in lockfile (P2, LOW, deferred)

Lockfile currently resolves `vite@5.4.21` AND `vite@6.4.2`:
- Astro 5.18 pulls Vite 6
- Vitest 2.1 + Playwright CT pull Vite 5

Two majors = duplicated tooling, slower CI, plugin-API mismatch risk. Vitest latest at recheck is 4.x; issue prescribes 3.x as Vite-6-compatible target.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Bump `vitest` 2.x → 3.x (or 4.x — revisit since 4 is now latest)
- [ ] Bump `@vitest/coverage-v8` to matching major
- [ ] If `@playwright/test` still pulls Vite 5, confirm it is a transitive devDep only and accept (Playwright CT's Vite dep is upstream-pinned)
- [ ] Verify `pnpm-lock.yaml` resolves a single Vite 6 entry (or document Playwright CT exception)

### Priority

| Item | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|
| D6 step 1 | HIGH | **Closed** — superseded by `@poukai-inc/ui@1.0.0` already on `main` |
| D1 React 19 | HIGH | **Open, gated** on DS [#105](https://github.com/poukai-inc/poukai-ui/issues/105) |
| D6 step 2 | HIGH | **Open, gated** — lands with D1 |
| D4 lucide alignment | MEDIUM | **Open** — cross-repo coordination required |
| C8 pnpm pin | LOW (P2) | **Open** — trivial, no blockers |
| C4 Vite duplication | LOW (P2) | **Open** — moderate risk; needs visual regression pass |
