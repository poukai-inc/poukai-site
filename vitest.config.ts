/**
 * Vitest config — unit tests for React component wrappers in src/components.
 *
 * Astro `.astro` files are not tested through vitest; they're rendered by the
 * build, covered by axe/lighthouse against `pnpm preview`, and visually by R20
 * (when wired). Vitest's job is the TypeScript/React seams between the site
 * repo and `@poukai-inc/ui`.
 *
 * R-058 (HARD when tests exist on changed files):
 *   - Line coverage on changed files must be ≥ 80%
 *   - Every new component ships with a smoke test
 *
 * Threshold is enforced via `coverage.thresholds`; if a future PR drops
 * coverage on a changed file, `pnpm test:coverage` exits non-zero.
