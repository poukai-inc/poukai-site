/**
 * HomeHero.tsx
 *
 * Thin React wrapper that assembles the homepage Hero with its complex JSX slots.
 * Lives in the site repo because passing JSX as a prop from an .astro file to a
 * React component causes esbuild to parse the .astro template as TypeScript, which
 * breaks on HTML attributes in the <head>. By wrapping here, index.astro passes
 * only scalar props across the boundary (same pattern as ShellWrapper.tsx).
 *
 * Decisions honoured:
 *   D-11 — integrated lede-extension link sentence at end of lede, href="/why-ai".
 *           Structural form locked. Exact wording is Draft: Arian approves final copy.
 *   D-12 — status-line text verbatim from public/index.html (now deleted):
 *           "Currently taking conversations for Q3."
 *
 * Rendered as static HTML at build time — no hydration directive (R-079).
